      "Pyrmont is an inner-city village of Sydney, only about 2kms from the Sydney CBD (Central Business District) / Core, right next door to Darling Harbour and Chinatown. https://www.airbnb.com.au/locations/sydney/pyrmont Pyrmont has a relaxed community feel with an inner city vibe. Pyrmont is only about 2kms (10 - 15 mins walk) from the centre of Sydney with an extensive range of local restaurants, wine bars, and pubs. There's some seriously good baristas and cafes right close to our home (Go and say hi to Damien & Tim at Bar Zini - it's one of our local faves). There's five star fine dining right through to greasy-spoon takeaways with some of Australia's finest dining restaurants within easy reach. * Darling Harbour and Cockle Bay * Exhibition and Convention Centres * Sydney Fish Markets * Pyrama Point Park * Jones Bay Wharf * The Star (Casino) with Food Halls, Bars, and the Lyric Theatre * Powerhouse Museum * National Maritime Museum Also (back on the food - notice a theme?): * Two groce\n",

      "notes\n",
      "We've a few reasons for the 6.00pm arrival time / check in / bag drop time... One of them is that we're really flexible with check out times. :) While we do work from home, we don't particularly want to broadcast on the internet if we are away from home. That's why our arrival time is always listed as 6pm. Our \"check in\" / \"arrival time\" / \"bag drop\" is all the same thing. It's not like we're a hotel with a team of porters waiting to take your bags any time of the day or night whether we're at home or not. So, if we haven't agreed some alternate arrangements, then we look forward to welcoming you to our home at 6.00pm. While we may be able to arrange some arrival times / bag drops / check ins earlier, we do need to make those arrangements well in advance. So if the 6.00pm check in time isn't your preference, please talk to us about it *before* you make your reservation. :)\n",

      "transit\n",
      "Our home is centrally located and an easy walk to everywhere (everywhere you want to go anyways). We also have easy access to trams (light-rail), trains, and ferries which are all conveniently a few minutes walk away. Transport options are great:  There's a bus, the 389, pretty much at our doorstep every 10 minutes. It goes into the City Centre, into Paddington, all the way to Bondi Beach and on to North Bondi - Doesn't get better than that! Trams (\"light-rail\") every 12 minutes. - Central Station, Fish Markets, The Star, Chinatown, Glebe - Central to Dulwich Hill. Ferries from Pyrmont Bay, Darling Harbour and Circular Quay are a great way to explore. Trains from Town Hall, Central, and Wynyard. A main Sydney City (Town Hall) train station is only 10-15 minutes walk away. Central Station is 15 - 20 minutes walk (5 mins by bus or tram). Airports: The international and Domestic airports are only about 15 - 20 minutes drive away (longer during traffic peaks), again, all easily accessible \n",

We've a kitchen and dining room for meals (and of course, feel free to use the fridge) and a sheltered, undercover area outside that you're more than welcome to use if you smoke. We tend to work from home, meet clients in our home office, and work by phone too. So this means that our home would be better suited to guests wanting to be out sightseeing during the day, rather than spending the days inside. (But why would you want to stay inside all day when there's so much to see and do anyway?) Every experience we've ever had with Airbnb has been a positive one. Whether we've been hosting, or staying as guests, we've met kind & considerate people, had interesting conversations, and made great new acquaintances & friends. We don't \n",

      "This was my first Airbnb experience and I am hooked! these guys are glorious . The most gracious hosts with generous hearts. Of course they do have many years experience running a BnB in Mudgie so they know the drill but that aside , they were welcoming, friendly, and forthcoming. I don't know Sydney and they do - which was they main reason I wanted to stay with an airbnb host. This is a great way to beat the lonely hotel blues, a great way to get that 'in' on local knowledge. A lovely room to stay in, fresh and clean - a wonderful breakfast early saturday morning before my flight home ( for which I appreciate and am eternally thankful) the fluffiest happiest best behaved dog Kenji i have ever met,  I thoroughly recommend these host and their home to all. . I think we are actually friends now! see you soonAs my first AirBnB experience, this was a magnificent introduction. Vinh and Stuart were superb hosts...and Kenji their Pomeranian, was equally enthusiastic but very well-behaved and unobtrusive. Their three-story terrace house was unpretentiously stylish but with a retreat-like, relaxed ambience, warm and light. The location was fantastically close to the essence of Sydney...Darling Harbour, Bay-side parks, the City, Circular Quay; all within an enjoyable walking distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In line with the AirBnB concept I felt the way in which we could share time was rich, informative and very flexible. I could come and go as I needed, enjoyed engaged conversation on occasions or the gift of attending to my own thoughts or activities comfortably as desired....A beautiful balance and repose. They also gave me access to their wifi which was great to maintain my internet commitments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even though they were often out enjoying to their own social activities Stuart and Vinh ensured that my son (who was occasionally visiting me) and I, felt entirely at home and even cooked us both a delicious breakfast with organic-market bought ingredients the morning I was scheduled to leave. The previous day we'd shared a walk down to the monthly Saturday morning market by the bay. I benefited too from hearing of their travel experiences and valued the opportunity to ask about their business venture...where they help creative people define and empower themselves to 'Make Tomorrow (Website hidden by Airbnb) much so that I've chosen to use their services!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So in essence...I'm very grateful, enthusiastic and inspired by the time spent with Vinh and Stuart and would highly recommend their 'AirBnB' experience. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Like many others this was my first AirBnB experience. I picked their home because it looked so beautiful and well kept.  Their home definitely exceeded my expectations. It was a real bonus when I realized just how close they were to the Darling Harbour.  Although it was only for a day, I felt really welcomed and taken care of. They even had a very yummy custard bun for me upon my arrival. I didn't realize it would be so cold in Sydney this time of year and had only brought a thin hoody.  It was so sweet and caring of Vinh to lend me his jacket for the day.  When I returned after all the sight-seeing, we ended up hanging out and talked the night away. Even though we went to bed quite late, they were kind enough to wake up in the wee hours of the morning just to drive me to the airport! Vinh & Stuart made my stay in Sydney so memorable. I can't even begin to express how much their kindness has touched my heart. I did not feel like just someone renting a room, but rather a visiting friend.Vinh and Stuart were very warm and hospitable, they did all they could to make our stay a comfortable one.  We went to the market with their friends and enjoyed a delicious breakfast and lots of interesting conversation.  We had a great time and would recommend them to everyone.I had a wonderful experience staying with Vinh and Stuart. They were thoughtful, friendly and warm hosts, very considerate and lovely to chat with. Their home is well located on a street with a great bakery, pubs, small shops, etc., and the guestroom was very peaceful with a skylight and a comfy bed. Breakfasts were fantastic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vihn is a great expert on Sydney and was very helpful for advice and suggestions on transport and things to do and see around town. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vihn and Stuart are lovely people and really made my stay enjoyable. I would certainly recommend staying with them! This was really a great experience.  The house is comfortable, elegant, and I really felt welcomed.  It's very well located and walking distance to Sydney downtown, many attractions, restaurants and pubs.  They were also very helpful with suggestions for places and directions.  Highly recommended!Oh my, where do I even start? \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Staying at Vinh and Stu's was definitely the highlight of our Sydney trip.\r\n",
      "They were the most welcoming and hospitable hosts anyone could ever dream for. Before we went to Sydney, they sent us a very detailed information pack, that even included the best taxi route from the airport to their home! In short, they are the BEST!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food and beverage they provided was definitely top quality, and their kitchen was simply amazing and oh so fully equipped. After a healthy and yummy breakfast, we are off to a day of sight-seeing (usually planned with the help of Vinh and Stu), and every night when we come back home we look forward to the interesting conversations with them =)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I can't praise the apartment enough. The location was simply superb, bus stops literally at the door step, heaps and heaps of cafes and restaurants, and walking distance to the Fish Market!! As you all can see from the photos, they have an absolutely breath-taking apartment. And let me tell you a little secret - the apartment is exactly as gorgeous as the photos are!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If that wasn't enough, I must confess that we seriously considered smuggling Kenji back to Melbourne with us... Hmmm... He is without a doubt the sweetest pup in the entire world. Extremely well behaved, he never barked once, and he just loves to cuddle and cuddle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dear Vinh, Stu and Kenji, thank you guys SO much for making our Sydney trip, and firt AirBnB experience simply amazing! Hope to see you guys in Melbourne soon! =)Ditto everything that has been said here about Vinh and Stuart (and of course Kenji, the best behaved Pom I have every met).  They are the consummate hosts and they have a stellar location for exploring Sydney.  We shared two fun evening dinners together.  The experience was exactly what I was hoping for when I signed up for AirBnB-- truly traveling like a human with all of the personal contact and comfort that implies.  I can only hope that the next time my travels take to me Sydney, Vinh and Stuart are still listing their room!  Thank you guys, it was a wonderful experience. My husband and I stayed with Vinh and Stuart during our honeymoon in October 2010. Vinh and Stuart were wonderful hosts to us in their beautiful home, and left us feeling as though we were visiting friends visiting, not strangers in a far away land.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can't recommend them highly enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My husband and I would love the opportunity to visit Sydney again someday, and look forward to seeing Vinh and Stuart when we do.What an absolute delight to meet Stuart and Vinh.  On arrival we received a very welcome pot of tea and sat chatting for about an hour before retiring.  Vinh was very helpful listening and advising us on our near future venture to build a b&b in Tasmania.  We are looking forward to keeping in touch and learning more through Vinh's business courses.I really enjoyed my recent stay with Vinh and Stuart.  They were friendly, welcoming and helped make my stay in Sydney a delight!  They made me dinner one evening and over the course of my four days we had some great conversations about artists, the business of art, food and of course AirBnB.  Staying at their place allowed me to have exactly the low key holiday that I had been hoping for.  Thanks again, guys!  Upon my arrival I was warmly greeted with a hot pot of tea, a breakfast pastry, and the affections of Kenji, their adorable pomeranian. After a bit of chatting, Stuart gave me a tour of the house and it's amenities. He even gave me a bus pass with a few rides left on it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their comfortable house is immaculately clean and conveniently located. The bus stops just right outside and I was within walking distance of most of the neighborhoods. There are also many restaurants to choose from within a radius of a few blocks. For those traveling without their laptop, they have an extra computer for guests to use.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stuart and Vinh are exceptional hosts – very friendly, helpful and a delight to talk to. On my next visit to Sydney I would stay with them again in a heartbeat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thanks for everything Stuart and Vinh, I couldn't have asked for anything more!All three lovely gentlemen (I include Kenji-dog here) were welcoming, easy to talk to, and made my stay a pleasure.Vinh and Stuart (and Kenji) couldn't have been better hosts. I was an Airbnb virgin and the experience has made me keen to do it again. They're so close to excellent public transport, I got from Pyrmont to the Opera House (including walking for 10 minutes across the forecourt) in under half an hour. Gorgeous bijou residence, no disturbance from neighbours, and just lovely hosts.Vinh and Stuart are caring and accommodating hosts.  They went out of their way to make us feel at home and comfortable.  The wifi connection was great and so was the taxi reservation!!  \r\n",
      "The information Vinh and Stuart provided before our visit was extremely helpful.  Thanks to these two delightful young men for making our time in Sydney very enjoyable.We really enjoyed our stay with Vinh and Stuart! This was the first time we used AirBNB and it was a great experience. Vinh and Stuart were very welcoming and were happy to tell us anything about Sydney. The house is very modern and artistic from the inside and has a great location.We stayed with Vinh and Stuart over New Years and it was just wonderful. Pure and simple. They are both so friendly and sweet, we had good laughs and they made us feel at ease from the minute we arrived. Great location for Sydney CBD. We can warmly recommend staying with these guys.Vinh and Stuart are very good hosts, very nice house, nice breakfast and  a very good location. Lovely dog (Kenji).  They gave me some nice tips about where to go and whats going on in the area. Can really recommend this place for a quick stop over in Sydney.\r\n",

      "KristinaWe stayed here for 5 days in January last year. The house was everything you could ask for when staying in central Sydney! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The location for getting around the city was ideal, within walking distance of the city center. The neighborhood is very elegant and close to the Darling Harbour. There you can enjoy a drink and there's a lot of choice from nice restaurants and cosy bars. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vinh & Stuart are wonderful hosts! We talked, we laughed, we drank wine, we had a really good time here! Would stay here again anytime!We´ve been with Vinh&Stuart for 4 nights in January 2011. Their home is lovely and looks really as shown.  It felt like coming home when they invited us to us their house. And in the evenings, coming back from an exciting day in Sydney,  Vinh was sitting at the table, \"ready\" for a litlle chat. The location is good: Bus stop, Supermarket, Cafe and great Thai across the street; 5 Minutes to Darling Harbour and 10 Minutes to Town Hall. Unfortunately they will move, so we´ve been the last guests. But we hope, they will share their new apt in Sydney also with AirBnB.Vinh and Stu are awesome hosts! Even their dog, Kenji was perfect - no barking just lots of love. Beautiful and clean home in Pyrmont, quieter then the CBD but literally a few minutes walk from it. Your own balcony, own bathroom really allowed us to have some time to ourselves plus the air conditioning really helped in the sweltering Australian heat. They are quite helpful in regards to answering any of your questions and they welcome you to use their laundry, kitchen and backyard patio as you please. Great guys - friendly, funny and sociable, I will definitely recommend to any of my friends who are looking for a place in Sydney!This was my first airbnb experience and I really enjoyed it. Staying at Stuart and Vinh`s place was excellent. The location is great, close by public transport and restaurants, cafes. It`s only  a 10 min walk to the CBD. Stuart and Vinh are very open and friendly. I definitely recommend staying there.We stayed with Vinh and Stuart for 3 days. We're so glad we found airbnb and especially that we stayed with Vinh and Stuart! Not only were they lovely but their home was comfortable and within walking distance to so many places! Vinh was lovely to chat with and even made Troy coffee. As we had a late flight on our last day, Vinh and Stuart were kind enough to let us leave our bags with them until we headed to the airport. Kenji is just as adorable and friendly as all the other comments say he is. If we visit Sydney again, we'd love to stay with Vinh and Stuart once more. Vinh & Stuart are most lovely hosts very warm and thoughtfull, Their comfy home is in a great location, a 2 min stroll down the road to heaps of lovely resturants so handy after a long day great choices if you want to grab a takeaway or dine in. Nice veiws of the harbour and a 15 min walk to darling harbour. Kenji their little dog is very freindly and very well behaved , I never heard a peep from him and was always there with a happy greeting each day. Great place comfy bed and great aircon. :)I spent a very memorable 3 nights in Sydney with Stuart and Vinh who where friendly, hospitable and excellent hosts…… at ease with their new guest, as I was with them. Their home is just as you see it in the description and photos but the one thing that was really a bonus was the location. If you like walking, then just seconds away you can be walking down steps to the waterfront and passing the finger wharfs on the way to Darling Harbour. If you prefer to use public transport, then the light rail tram is just 2 mins away with a choice of stops. I tended to arrive back late at night but felt completely safe in this area. Just one minute away are several restaurants and my favourite was the Japanese where I had a mix of sushi and sashimi…….all very fresh and served by enthusiastic and dedicated staff. My other favourite dish was breakfast where I was encouraged to just help myself to whatever I fancied in the kitchen. Stuart and Vinh are highly recommended and I have no hesitation in staying there again.Staying with Vinh and Stu was my husband and my first Airbnb experience, and we have nothing but good things to say about it.  We spent most of our time out and about, but Vinh and Stu were very accomodating with our early mornings and late(ish) nights, and always available with suggestions for the day or encouragement to try Vegemite.  The house was gorgeous and in a great location.  Definitely recommended.We loved our stay at Vinh and Stuarts. From the moment we arrived, they made us feel so so welcome. The house is stunningly decorated and is located perfectly - just a short bus ride or 20 minute walk to Downtown. We enjoyed breakfast out in their garden overlooking the water and, after a day's sightseeing, we looked forward to catching up with our hosts in the evening. We could not have wished for a better - first-time - air bnb experience. My vacation in Sydney was a very memorable one. As with any time away from home, accomodation is a huge part of the overall experience. Vinh and Stuart have a great thing going and seem to have a really good handle on providing safe and comfortable lodging to their tourist guests. Their seemed to be no gap between the host and guest. It was one happy family and I especially enjoyed the Pyrmont neighbourhood. I'd surely be a repeat guest. Shane Doucette, Nova Scotia, Canada Vinh and Stu's accommodations are great and they are both amazing hosts. I can't say enough good things about them during my week long stay in Sydney. What I loved about them was after a long day of sight-seeing, coming back to their place was always a fun time, knowing I would see both of them. We would talk for hours about everything from what I did that day to more in depth things like our background, our jobs, our family, our passions, etc. It was much more than just a place to sleep at night. You got a warm, homey, welcoming feeling staying at Vinh and Stu's that you would be extremely hard pressed to find at many 5 star hotels. And on top of that, their Pomeranian Kenji is the sweetest, cutest dog on the face of the earth. If you're a dog lover like I am, you will be at home knowing he will be excited to see you when you come home at night. All in all, I highly recommend Vinh and Stu to anyone thinking of staying in Sydney for business or pleasure. Next time I am back in Sydney, I will stay with Vinh and Stu (and Kenji) in a heartbeat.Vinh and Stuart are really friendly and helpful hosts. They are always ready for any assist as per your request. They even helped to take our two heavy cases to upstairs. Vinh is really a good friend you can chat with on everything. Every morning you can find everything is in order and clean. You can use the kitchen and laundary as you are at home. The location of the accomodation is quite, safe to close to the city. It took us 15 minutes walk to Gorge St and tram and bus stop are 5 minutes away. Sitting in the living room for breakfast, you can see the harbor from the window and you can walk 2 minutes to touch the sea. The lovely dog Kenji is well behaved and always friendly to anyone. We will stay with Vinh and Stuart once more when we visit Sydney next time. \r\n",
      "Johnston&EffieStayed with Vinh and Stuart for two nights and loved the room ,comfy bed and great setup house ,bathroom,kicthen and view over bay.Vinh and Stuart where very welcoming and helpful with getting around Sydney. We will be staying with them again and reconmended friends to do the same .Thanks guys for a great time.Sandi  and RodVinh nd Stuart wrote such lovely words about me it is now my turn!!  I felt very very happy to be in their home.  It was my first airbnb experience and these guys were fantastic.  I didnt want to (Website hidden by Airbnb) fact I am going back next week.  Their home is not just a beautiful and gracious abode it is filled with such friendliness and has a great feeling to it which is because these guys are just the best!  Nothing was too much trouble.  Being away on business this was an alternative to soulless hotel rooms for me and at the end of the day it was so lovely to go home!  We had several great conversations and I found them both so interesting and easy to chat with.  If I keep saying nice things everyone will go there and I want to make sure there is a room for me everytime i go to Sydney!!!!  Five stars plus.  Thanks guys. LisaThanks again Vinh and Stu! I had a lovely time seeing you guys before I jetted out back to the States after my long 3 week holiday. I'm glad you guys enjoyed my photos and after our many conversations about them, I am ready to to pursue my passion and see where it takes me. And I can say now that I have friends' for life in Vinh and Stu. Such great, caring people I was fortunate to cross paths with through AirBnB. I will definitely try to make it back to Sydney in the future and will be staying with you guys in a heartbeat. Thanks again and stay in touch!Staying at Stuart and Vihn's home was my first Airbnb experience and a very positive one. Prior to my arrival,Ii received very detailed directions to their house and other important information. Upon arrival and throughout my stay, they were both very cordial, informative and helpful with making my Sydney experience a positive one. Their condo is beautiful, clean and very strategically located to Darling Harbor. A very pleasurable experience: Vinh, Stuart, and Kenji are the perfect hosts. Recommended: sitting on the deck at the back looking out on the bay.Wonderful spot, with friendly and hospitable hosts.Our stay in Sydney has been great! Vinh+Stuart are such a good host! The location is very convenient..... we can walk to the City, China Town, Fish Market comfortably! It's been great! Beautiful accommodation, well placed for getting in to Central Station or walking to Darling Harbour.  Vinh and Stuart were charming hosts.This was my first airbnb experience (and my first bnb experience) ever. And my gosh, I'll never stay in a hotel in Sydney again if there's a chance I can hang out at Stuart and Vinh's home again. These guys are charming, genuine hosts who seem to have this remarkable ability to give you the exact experience you need. The room and house is wonderful, the bathroom is perfect and the views are sensational. Want to stay in and work? No worries! Feeling like a chat? They are wonderful conversationalists. Want to explore? They'll point you in the right direction. Honestly, I cannot imagine how anyone could be a better host. These guys are generous to the core, and I feel lucky to have met them.Vinh and Stuart (and Kenji) are perfect AirBnB hosts-- they provided everything we needed plus some (tidy room, private bath, all amenities) and were there to provide us with friendly advice and conversation while respecting our privacy. We had a wonderful time, and will be staying with them again next time we visit Sydney!It was the first time I tried Airbnb. Unlike other hosts here(such as Dylan W), they are responsive to my inquiries. I enjoyed my stay with Vinh+Stuart Horrex. The location is great. You can just walk to the Darling Harbour. The bus stop is just less than a minute walk away that you can take it to the Town Hall & Circular Quay (the Opera House). The house is quiet. Minor things for improvement : more space is needed in the cabinet in the toilet and the wardrobe in the room for guests to put their stuff. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was busy travelling and came back late. So I didn't have much time to talk with both hosts. Anyway, they are very nice people. They are flexible about the check in & out time. Therefore I could make full use of my time to rest & travel. And the dog is so cute! To conclude,  I would recommend it to people travelling to Sydney.execellent stay. enjoyed itThis is a great location, especially as i was attending a conference at Darling Harbour - walking distance. Fabulous range of restaurants and cafes steps away - plus a beauty salon on the same street! Easy walk to public transport. On top of all that Vinh and Stuart are perfect hosts - friendly, interesting and informative, yet allowing privacy.Stuart and Vihn are warm, welcoming, and easy going hosts. Its a beautiful home, the location is quiet, villagey and safe, and so so close to the city (you can even walk across Pyrmont Bridge into the CBD). I had a wonderful stay, they made everything so easy, the comfortable room contains all you would need, and bonus - super cute cuddly Pomeranian Kenji!! Would definitely return.I couldn't have asked for a better first introduction to AirBNB. The hosts were very trusting and flexible in their arrangements for me considering I had to be at a conference at all hours of the day and night. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The house was warm and homely with full access to the kitchen and coffee making facilities (which I didn't need to use as I had all of that provided at the conference.) \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The location is unbeatable and I walked from Milsons Point back to Pyrmont in only a couple of hours. Very close to the city. \r\n",

      "The bed is comfortable and their is air con if you get cold of a night. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Why stay in a hotel when you can stay here and get a better experience for the same price!We had a great time staying with Vinh and Stuart in Pyrmont. They are very friendly and helpful but don't invade your space.\r\n",
      "Their house is lovely and within walking distance of Darling Harbour so makes a great base from which to explore Sydney.\r\n",
      "The power was off in their street on our first night, which made going downstairs to the loo in the middle of the night an adventure! But they very kindly gave us a bottle of wine to make up for the inconvenience. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend Vinh and Stuart as hosts. Airbnb gives a much richer experience than staying in an impersonal hotel.Awesome location.  Awesome house.  Awesome room.  Awesome hosts.  Awesome coffee machine! Nuff said ;-)Terrific location and everything was exactly as described.   Vihn & Stuart were great hosts. I hate to give Vinh and Stuart a good review because I want to be able to stay with them the next time I need a host in Sydney!  These two gentlemen are simply wonderful and I had a lovely time as a guest in their home.  They are very welcoming and easy to talk with, and their home is simply lovely.  The location is perfect too - very close to the center of Sydney, yet in a quiet neighborhood.  And Kenji the dog is gorgeous.  Vinh and Stu are lucky I didn't take him home with me upon leaving.  :)Thank you to Stuart and Vinh for providing us with such a wonderful home base for our stay in Sydney! They made us feel very welcome and offered excellent advice while we toured the area. We enjoyed our conversations and learning about Australia. The bed was very comfortable, the house is quiet and breakfast was perfect. We would  recommend Stuart and Vinh's highly and without reservation.\r\n",

      "Sue and DaveOur stay in Vinh and Stuart's house was fantastic. They both were very kind, open-minded and helpful. The house is pretty and well located. We really enjoyed staying there and we think that it is the best place to stay in Sydney. We recommend everybody to go there.The host canceled my reservation 120 days before arrival.Wonderful place to stay, Vinh and Stuart make you feel welcome in their cozy, tastefully appointed home in this peaceful neighborhood. Everything you need is nearby: great restaurants, grocery stores and public transportation. Perfect, to use as a base, to explore Sydney.Vinh was a terrific host. He made me feel at home, provided great conversation, and the place was super lovely. Very clean, great location, great views. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend the place to anyone looking for a central (yet quiet) place to stay in Sydney.Beautiful home, fabulous location, wonderful hosts-- this was our first experience with airbnb.com and we couldn't have asked for a better one!  Vinh and Stuart were friendly and welcoming, and they were conscientious hosts as well-- even leaving information (and discounts) to local attractions in our room and calling a cab for us when it was time to go.  They are perfect examples of Australian hospitality and we look forward to staying with them again when we return!   (Plus, their super-friendly, super-quiet, super-adorable little dog is the icing on the cake.) Stuart and Vinh are perfect Airbnb hosts. Their house is lovely--comfortable and inviting and elegant. The location could not be better. It's in a great neighborhood for walking, shopping, and just hanging out. And has good transportation, with a bus, tram, and ferry practically on the doorstep. But, they are the real attraction. They made me feel welcome in every way. We had great conversations, and I feel that I am leaving Sydney with 2 new friends. Lovely hosts. The house is nice, with comfortable spaces and in a great location for exploring Sydney.Once again, another wonderful stay with Vinh and Stuart (and their gorgeous pomeranian). It's a shame they are such lovely hosts – I really want to spend more time with them. Next time I'll have to stay an extra day, I think. These guys tick all the boxes, and I really can't fault this experience in any way. Everything was perfect, and I'm so happy to have met them. Highly recommended!If I travel to Sydney again, Vinh & Stuart will be my top Airbnb choice. Stuart and Vinh are wonderful and very helpful hosts. Their house is beautiful and the view from the terrace and kitchen is amazing. Very convenient for great restaurants and busing to the CBD. The bedroom is lovely and cozy (could've done with a little closet space). Bring your slippers to wear upstairs! Kenji was an added bonus as we missed our dog back in the States. \r\n",
      "Thanks again Stuart and Vinh for adding to the already wonderful experience on our return trip to Sydney.  Stuart and Vinh were wonderful and helpful hosts. A beautiful bedroom warm and cozy. Kitchen facility excellent with lovely view from the terrace off the kitchen. Great restaurants within one block! But for bathroom being downstairs next to the kitchen, I would give this airbnb 5 stars. Loved having Kenji around as we missed our dog back home.I had an amazing stay with Stuart and Vinh. They were fantastic hosts. Their home is warm and cozy. Loved the nice, modern bathroom and comfortable (Website hidden by Airbnb) were very welcoming and friendly and full of great information about the local area.The neighborhood they live in is filled with wonderful (non-touristy restaurants) and only 5 minutes or less to reach the light rail on foot. Very centrally located. You can walk everywhere or take rail or ferry transport. I would highly recommend staying here and I will too on my return visit to Sydney. P.S. Their little dog Kenji is so cute!!2 nice and very helpful guys.  Nice place very close to everything!Vinh & Stuart's (and Kenji's!) home is excellent! The location of the house is just perfect for a walk into the city! Very convenient! Their home is really beautiful, neat and tidy. Just behind their home is Prymont Point Park, and it has such a beautiful skyline- you can see the Harbour Bridge! The hosts were very welcoming and warm, giving lots of help prior and during the stay. Thank you for everything!  Stuart & Vinh's home is super central. I recommend it as it is so close to the city. Location is no 1. You can be walking distance from the city & yet it's such a private & quiet spot. not to mention beautiful with the water in front. Kenji ( thier dog ) was a darling & eager to make friends with anyone. We were there for a weekend wedding which was so convenient. We'd return anytime if they're still available. :)Vinh and Stu's place s perfectly located for exploring Sydney. Close enough to venture into the city, far enough away to be nice and quiet. The views out the back of the house are fantastic and the house is within an easy 10 minute walk of Darling Harbour with all its bars, restaurants and shops.\r\n",
      "Vinh and Stu are fantastic hosts, they are an easy laid back pair who are great to talk to and incredibly accommodating with lots of advice on the city to share.\r\n",
      "I would highly recommend Vinh and Stu and when we return to Sydney we will certainly look them up again.As they say in New York, Location, Location, Location!  Whether you are a walker or prefer public transportation, it is easy to walk or use the tram/bus to the common places like Darling Harbour, downtown Sydney, etc.  Vinh and Stuart go out of their way to make sure you have the information to get around.  On a personal note, Vinh showed me how my travel blog could connect with website.  His enthusiasm got me off my tush and start writing again!  I slept in the upstairs room (and the bed is very comfortable) and later when my husband came, the second floor room.  You do have to be prepared to go to the first floor for a night time bathroom run but other than that, it's perfect!To say that it exceeded our expectations is a gross understatement! Rarely have stayed anywhere that we felt more part of the family and were treated so well. If you stay anywhere else when you visit Sydney you will be missing out on one of the cities main attractions. Thank you guys for making our precious holiday time so special.Vinh & Stuart were perfect hosts, friendly and not intrusive.  We felt like we were staying with old friends.  Vinh & Stuart kindly helped us up the stairs with our baggage.  Plenty of choice re tea/coffee.  Plentiful supply of breakfast foods.  Comfortable and private room.  Great location and close to transport.  Vinh told us of the local's secret, the Fish Market, where we enjoyed a sumpuous seafood meal.  This was our first experience of Air BnB and it certainly was very positive, we will certainly stay here again when back in Sydney.  Great value.Vinh & Stuart were absolutely delightful hosts. A lovely home and a lovely atmosphere. Well positioned and appointed. We couldn't have asked for more. Thanks very much, we look forward to staying again :) Only stayed for a couple of nights but were made to feel most welcome. Location was excellent with a great local pub. Both Vin & Stuart were excellent hosts but very much just let you get on with things and offered advice and help about Sydney if you needed it. I would highly recommend staying with them.Mal auf Deutsch: Der Aufenthalt bei den beiden war insgesamt sehr harmonisch, wir freuten uns vor allem an dem Blick von der kleinen Terasse auf das Wasser. Die Küche ist - de facto - nicht für die Nutzung durch andere gedacht. Aber ansonsten war alles zu unserer Zufriedenheit.We would just like to thank Vinh & Stuart for making our 1st Airbnb such an easy & enjoyable experience, we felt that Vinh went out of his way to give us advise during our holiday and found them both to be extremely kind and genuine hosts who we would not hesitiate to stay with again, thank you again for your making us feel so comfortable in your lovely home.\r\n",
      "Mike & JacquieGreat BnB in a funky area of Sydney.  Excellent light rail or bus transport to the CBD.  Vinh & Stuart were very hospitable.  The room is bright with a very comfortable bed.  This was my first Airbnb stay and am keen to do it again after such a great experience. The hosts were wonderful, as was the view! They provided us with directions around the places we needed to go and assisted us with public transport information. They were very accommodating and made myself and my friend feel at home. We had a very busy schedule and unfortunately didn't get to spend much time in there lovely apartment. It was immaculate, with full kitchen use, own bathroom, WIFI connection, a comfortable bed after a busy day and a key to come and go as we needed. Thanks Guys! (And special mention to the Pomeranian who was just so cute :)We had a wonderful stay with Vinh (Stuart was out on business). Their house is tastefully decorated with a view to the water, clean, comfortable, and easy access to the city center. Vinh is very friendly and helpful with good advice how to go about the city. We enjoyed our stay and conversation with him, and have no hestation to recommend their house to our friends. And we hope we'll visit them again.We found Vinh and Stuart to be delightful hosts, and my wife fell in love with their dog \"Kenji\", their sweet and quiet Pomeranian.

Siamo stati nella loro casa per 3 notti nel periodo di Natale e ci ha fatto tanto piacere conoscere delle persone così aperte e socievoli, che ci hanno raccontato un po' la loro storia e il loro passato, il tutto mentre il bellissimo cane Kenji ci divertiva con le sue corse e la sua ciotola a forma di corona. La casa è molto bella e in una posizione comoda, a 15 minuti di cammino dal bellissimo Darling Harbour. Grazie ragazzi e a presto!Vinh and Stuart are absolutely friendly, even their little pet Kenji. The location is absolutely convenient, we can just walk to Darling Harbour within 10 mins, fist market within 15mins (depends on your speed), we can catch a bus to the city within 10mins (check the timetable to save your waiting time). \r\n",

You can also do your washing if you needed, they have both washing machine and dryer, everything just ready and handy here. \r\n",

Would definitely recommend staying with them.Nous avons beaucoup apprecie notre sejour a Sydney grace a la qualite de l'accueil. L'emplacement est ideal pour decouvrir Sydney et nous avons d'ailleurs visite la ville a pied, sauf pour une escapade a Manly. Nos hotes ont tout fait pour rendre notre sejour agreable et confortable. Le quartier de Pyrmont est reposant et on a un peu l'impression d'etre dans un village.Vinh, Stuart and Kenji have a lovely place a short hop, skip and jump from all that is Sydney. Whilst we were out and about for most of the time it was great to have a comfy bed and good company to come back to.\r\n",

      "Next time we're in Sydney we'd most certainly consider staying with them again! Recommended!Thanks Vinh and Stuart for opening your home to us.  Your house is lovely and so quiet given it is walking distance from the CBD.  Could not ask for nicer hosts. Be well.  PVinh and Stuart are gracious hosts and their home is both lovely and convenient.

      "Vinh and Stuart graciously invite you to use their kitchen, including utensils, condiments, spices, etc.  Also, visitors can use their laundry facilities (which was quite helpful for us!)   They have a lovely dog named Kenji, who is one of the sweetest and most polite dogs that we've met.  And they have a wonderful back patio with views of the water.\r\n",

      "We highly recommend Vinh & Stuart's house!We only had a few days in beautiful Sydney and this was just the perfect place to start exploring the city. Everything is in walking distance and walking is great in Sydney, but public transportation is also nearby so you can go everywhere in no time.\r\n",
      "Stuart and Vinh are great hosts, very forthcoming, helpful and we would have loved to stay longer. Everything is spotlessly clean, comfortable and cozy, just perfect.This was a great location to everything in Sydney.  If you are an avid walker like my wife and I -you can see it all.  The accomodations were fine and there is even a view of the bay. Both Vinh and Stuart were very accomodating to make sure our stay was pleasantVinh and Stuart were the perfect hosts I loved staying in their lovely home,their little dog Kenzie was so well behaved and adorable. Vinh and Stuart couldnt have been more hospitable,kind and welcoming.I really enjoyed my stay there and especially the lovely coffeeWe had a wonderful time at Vinh and Stuart's! Thanks for your hospitality.This place is great… clean, homely, comfortable bed, quiet location with harbour views. The bus and light train are only  2 minutes away and Darling Harbour and the Pyrmont ferry only a 10 minute walk.  Vinh and Stuart are gracious hosts who clearly enjoys having guests and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. Would definitely recommend staying with them.Staying with Vinh and Stuart was a pleasure.  We did not see much of Stuart as he was busy working but Vinh was very helpful and friendly.  We enjoyed our conversations with him.  The room was a good size and clean.  And the place is in a nice location.  Would recommend staying there.We had a lovely weekend in Sydney courtesy of Vinh and Stuart and their stunning house in Pyrmont.  Great location for easy access to the city and with such friendly hosts we had a great time.  Very clean and comfortable house with a great bedroom.  The comfy bed was most welcome after a 24 hour flight.  We'd definitely stay again if we're ever in Sydney.My stay with Vinh and Stuart was fantastic. They house is amazing and they are wonderful hosts who made me feel entirely at home. Open, relax and very helpful, they made my short stay in Sydney very special. The house is in a beautiful position and in a part of town that it is easily accessible by public transport. You can even walk from there to CBD and to all Sydney's iconic tourist attractions. Highly recommended. Vinh & Stuart are really nice people. Their place is near the city center so we could see most of it by walking. The room is very comfy and they both respected our privatcy. And for our trip to Vietnam and Hong Kong we got so many helpful information. Thank you so much for that! It was a pleasure for us to stay at their house. We would recommend them to anyone. Vinh and Stuart were wonderful hosts. We stayed three night at their home in Sydney. They are really friendly, generous and helpful. It was a pleasure to be your guest! The room was very cosy, everything was very clean. The location (Pyrmont) is quiet although the attractions are in possible walking-distance.I stayed with Vinh and Stuart for a couple of nights over the Easter break. Their house is fantastic and they are wonderful hosts who were always up for a chat. The location is great, the room(and the whole house) was extremely clean and the hosts were every bit as nice and helpful as others have written in their reviews. It was an all round great experience and I dare say they will be seeing me again!We had a wonderful stay with Vinh & Stuart in Pyrmont - it's the perfect location with the ocean out the backdoor, easy walk to Sydney Fish Market, The Star, Chinatown, Darling Harbour & also Pyrmont Bay if you want to catch the ferry. The Light Rail is only a few min away & nearby Harris St has ample restaurants & cafes to choose from including Pyrama which does amazing breakfast! They were thoughtful & friendly hosts, not to mention their adorable Pomeranian Kenji who is very affectionate & well-behaved~~we felt immediately at home. Their terrace house is beautifully decorated & the bedroom very spacious, you also get your own balcony with a patio set. The location is very safe & quiet with unmatched convenience. Thank you again for having us & we would love to return later on!  \r\n",
      "Denise & Billy We are very pleased by our stay at Vihn and Stuart's place. We stayed there for 2 days. Their home is very beautiful and tastefully furnished. Vihn and Stuart were great hosts providing a service beyond our expectations trying to accommodate every need we may had and make our stay as pleasant as possible. A major advantage was the location of the house, next to Darling Harbour and really close to the city centre.We definitely recomend it.Had a great stay with Vinh and Stuart. Great place in a great location that was a good place to base ourselves for a few days in Sydney. Would happily stay here again, if it's available. Paula and I recently stayed with Vinh and Stuart before departing on a trip to the Philippines. Vinh and Stuart made us feel very welcome and cheerfully shared their knowledge of activities and the best places to dine locally. Their hospitality is some of the best we have experienced. \r\n",

      "The location of  their property is very convenient to the joys of the Daring Harbour precinct. We were able to walk into the city and surrounding areas with ease. We even walked to Roselle for a beer and a feed at the Three Weeds  Hotel - an old haunt of ours.  The property is truly \"Sydney City and Harbour at the door\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For anyone contemplating a short break or a place to stay in Sydney before departing on an overseas trip, this is the place to go. We hope to make Vinh and Stuart's property a regular place to stay when visiting Sydney in the future.\r\n",

My room also had a balcony; great:) Their place is situated within walking distance to the CBD, but if you're not much of a walking person, there's a bus just outside the door. I would stay here again:)Memorable stay in Vinh and Stuart's home.  Very comfortable, and beautifully maintained house.  Vinh and Stuart made us feel very welcome. Delightful to sit at breakfast table with view over the water.  Transport to city practically at door. Highly recommend staying here.

If I get to go to Sydney again, I would be happy to stay here.Just wanna say that I had an awesome Sydney Holiday! This is due to Vinh and Stuart providing some great tips. Their place is freaking convenient,a minute walk to the tram stop and bus stop. The Star is nearby and with darling harbour and fish market nearby.Many cafes and restaurants within walking vicinity.Their place is a top choice for u guys to choose if u are going to Sydney. Get a mymulti pass if u are staying for 3 days or more, it definitely worth it. U will love Kenji the pomeranian. My stay at their place was simply great! Will love to go back sydney very soon! :) We had a wonderful time. The little dog was overwhelmingly friendly. The apartment was very tasteful and the owner very helpful and friendly. There was a busstop right on our doorsteps and 5 minutes walk to the tram, very convenient. From the kitchen you had a fantstic view on the bay. It was situated not far from all the attractions. very recommendable!Had a wonderful  time in Sydney and enjoyed the incredible location of Stuart &Vinhs` home.  Helpful hosts who provided very explicit information on location ,transport ,restaurants etc.\r\n",

My parents loved their stay there. They kept telling me how friendly they were, as a matter of fact, Vinh speaks many languages, and my parents said it was like talking to an old friend. That was the most positive AirBnB experience that I could have hoped for them.\r\n",

Stuart and Vinh were very welcoming and provided some great suggestions for us. Felt very at home :o) The accommodation was exactly what we expected and was very clean and comfortable.Sono stata benissimo con Vihn, Stuard e la deliziosa Kenji, erano molto gentili e sempre disponibili verso di me. Tornare a casa dopo essere stata nel caos del C.B.D. era veramente rilassante. La casa e' bella e la vista sulla baia e' deliziosa. la zona e'  tranquilla ed e' veramente a 10 minuti a piedi  verso il centro. Tutto era sempre in ordine e sempre tutto a disposizione. Raccomando  veramente ad altri hosts.\r\n",
      " Grazie tantissimo, è stato bello per me incontrarvi .We had a great time staying with Vinh and Stuart. The house is in an excellent location and we managed to walk to nearly everywhere! There were also a number of lovely restaurants nearby that luckily also stayed open quite late! The only downside was building work next door, but that's something that none of us could do much about!\r\n",

      "I would definitely recommend Vinh&Stuart's place to anyone looking to spend time looking around Sydney. And Kenji is adorable :)Such a great place in the heart of Sydney! My partner and I stayed with Vinh and Stuart and had an amazing time. Their house is lovely and in an incredible location. Views of Darling Harbour at night are stunning and the 443 bus right outside their house takes your directly to Circular Quay. The area surrounding the house is filled with delicious restaurants so we didn't even feel the need to return to the CBD each night for dinner. The bed in the first floor bedroom is very big and quite comfortable with heat and a/c control.  They are both also very welcoming and Kenji is just a ball of friendly energy. Highly recommended!Very good location in a quiet neighbourhood. There's a bus that takes you directly to Circular Quay. The room is comfortable with heater available. The toilet is cleaned daily with shower facilities and hair dryer. There are bread, jam, coffee and tea available in the kitchen and a very nice porch to enjoy breakfast with beautiful view of the sea. It's a very comfortable stay and highly recommended to travellers! I miss their little cute dog Kenji! To stay with Vinh and Stuart has been great! From the very moment I entry in the house I knew that I had made the right election. They explained to me how to get to the places I needed to go and gave me details about the nicest spots. It was very interesting to share our experiences about travelling and other aspects of life. Kenji, their beatiful pomerian was very cheerfull and gave me a grat welcome every time I arrived to the house. The place was very beautiful, clean and tidy in a superb location. Just in front of the sea, near Darling Harbour, and very well comunicatd with the city and the airport by tram and bus. I highly recomend their place and if I go back to Sydney I will definetly stay again with them. Thank you!Wir waren das erste Mal mit AirBnb unterwegs, aber wir glauben nicht, dass es einen viel besser antreffen kann als bei Vinh und Stuart.\r\n",
      "Die zwei waren sehr nett, unkompliziert, immer hilfsbereit, und wir haben uns super mit ihnen unterhalten.\r\n",
      "Das Haus ist in einer spitzen Lage, mit direktem Blick auf's Wasser von der schönen Terasse, und von oben bis unten sauber und schön eingerichtet. Man kann von dort aus alles super erreichen, mit Bus, Bahn, Fähre oder sogar zu Fuß.\r\n",

I love how quite and peaceful the place is and that it actually is only about 10 minutes walk to Darling Harbour!It was a pleasure staying with Vihn and Stuart.  The historic townhome could not be more conveniently located in the fabulous Pyrmont area.  Close to public transportation, neighborhood bistros and Darling Harbour, it is a perfect spot to come home to at the end of a day of sightseeing in the spectacular city that is Sydney.  Vihn and Stewart will make you feel right at home and you are free to come and go as you need.  Their directions are spot on which made finding them via the train from the airport extremely easy.  I highly recommend Vinh and Stewart's lovely home.  Plus, they are just simply great guys.We couldn't have had a more enjoyable stay. Great hosts, considerate, accommodating and friendly.  Wonderful digs with a lovely view of the harbor and the coffee is as good as they claim.\r\n",

Their house is impeccably clean and very close to everything in the centre of the city and both had great recommendations for places to eat and where the local buses went from etc. Their small Pomeranian dog Kenjy was very cute and we enjoyed his company while we had breakfast.  Both Vinh and Stuart respected our privacy and we both enjoyed our stay with them. Highly recommended!Vinh and Stuart were really great host! \r\n",

The neighborhood is quiet but hip--withing walking distance to everything--and Vinh could not have been a more gracious, generous host. When my girlfriend showed up with a smattering of painful bug bites from a brief stay in Fiji , Vinh was right there with the calamine lotion--asking nothing in return. A warm, wonderful place to stay that I could not recommend enough for anyone heading to Sydney. Had a great stay with Vihn and Stuart, for 4 days.  Bed was comfortable, room quiet and individually climate-controlled, and their home conveniently located near public transport.  Good place for the active tourist to explore the City.  Very friendly host, made sure everything is sorted out even when they're not home. Lovely house, with a beautiful view at the back.\r\n",

Sehr zu empfehlen!!We had a fantastic time in Sydney, and having a wonderful place to return to after a full day of activities is truly awesome.

The house was very neat and clean as well as our bathroom and our room. We had free coffee, tea, and breakfast in the morning which is great when your on a budget. We had a great experiance staying here, we would definitely do it again. Vinh was very accommodating, he helped us out so much, whether it be which bus to take or which places to eat, he was really nice.  I sprained my ankle in the blue mountains and he gave me ice to help with the inflammation. We even forgot our luggage in the room when we checked out and when we came back from the airport, he had our luggage ready outside and gave me extra cash for the taxi cab. We can't take you enough for your hospitality Vinh!!! Definitely stay here, its walking distance to everything, with a great host too!Vinh and Stuart were fantastic hosts. My room was beautifully furnished and very clean. Their little dog Kenji was also fun to have around - very friendly and well-behaved.

We fell in love with the dog! ;) Thank you! :) We had a great time in Sydney. Vinh was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and bus and other travel info. Booked a taxi for us back to the airport. Lovely room. Bathroom is downstair and bedroom up which is a bit difficult for those of us older ones who have to visit it several times during the night. Overall great.Vinh, Stuart, and Kenji (the very adorable dog) are wonderful hosts and very warm and welcoming. The house is a beautiful Victorian in a nice  neighborhood,  with comfortable bed, modern shower, and well appointed coffee bar for those coffee enthusiasts.  It's located just a few bus stop from the Maritime Museum and Star Casino. Also just 10? minute  light rail to central station so very conveniently located.  Highly recommend to other bnb members.This is a great location and Vinh and Stu were very flexible with my schedule having had a very hectic week of business In Australia.  The house is very easy to find and very easy to get to using public transport and there are also loads of taxis nearby if you want to head out of the area.  It's also very easy to walk into the CBD.

Vinh and Stuart were really welcoming, and made some great suggestions about local places to eat and visit. We enjoyed our time with them (and Kenji) and would visit again if given the chance!This was a nice introduction to airbnb. It was nice to be greeted by Stuart, and to be shown around the house.

      "Für mich und meine erwachsene Tochter war es die erste Reise mit Airbnb wir waren sehr positiv überrascht es hat alles wunderbar geklappt. Vinh und Stuart sind überhaupt sehr nett und hilfsbereit wir haben uns in ihrem wunderbaren Heim sehr wohlgefühlt. Die Wohnung liegt zentral und ist ein guter Ausgangsort für Unternehmungen rund um Darling Harbour auch der Bus ins Stadtzentrum und zu den Fähren ist direkt vor der Haustür. Wir vermissen jetzt schon den herrlichen Ausblick von der Terrasse auf den Hafen. Vinh & Stuarts place was in a great location for seeing the city.  Vinh greeted us when we arrived & got us situated.  He was very informative & supportive of us getting our legs under us before jet lag set in.  He gave us great ideas for what to see & do.  He even loaned us an umbrella because it was raining off & on.  We loved using their kitchen to prepare meals(we have food allergies).  They gave us our space, but where always available to assist us.  We also fell in love with their dog Kenji! What an adorable boy.  We would definitely recommend them.Wij gebruikten voor het eerst het aanbod via Airbnb, Vinh en Stuart ontvingen ons rustig en zorgden er voor dat wij ons enkele dagen 'thuis' voelden.\r\n",

      "Lyn & Rex Vinh had been extremely friendly and providied us with a clean and beautiful home. Not forgetting his lovely dog Top spot! Top host! Vinh bravo! What a friendly, comfortable and relax environment to stay on your next visit to Sydney.  Walk to all the all the  city sights  from fish market to Darling Harbour.  Its all accessible by foot or public transport.  Chill on the verandah with bay views or  read your fav novel.  Treat it with respect and it gives back a thousand fold.This in a home away from home.Vinh, Stuart and Kenji were really great hosts. The home is beautiful and very centrally located, short walk to darling harbour, great restaurants, public transport linking you to anywhere in the city including the airport. Just a great place to be. The guys + Kenji were wonderful hosts, made my mom and I feel very welcome. They are very accommodating, and knowledgable about the city, perfect of for a first time visitor such as myself. Definitely recommend staying with them. CheersVinh + Stuart are delightful hosts and made us feel very welcome. The location of their lovely home made visiting Sydney easy and we hope to return againVinh & Stuart and of course Kenji !! They all absolutly fantastic !!! Vinh answered my questions immediately in advance. The house was amazing. Vinh wait for me at my late arrivel and helped me out with my luggage and advised shortly the places in the house. We had short conversations with Vinh which i liked very much as they were very lovely..... Kenji is an amazing dog !!! Sooooo sweet.... Location and view are fantactic !!! I can't recommend staying in this lovely accommodation with Vinh, Stuart and Kenji and at Pyrmont enough. It was also safe for singler traveller even late in the evening. Stuart, Vinh and of course Kenji are brilliant hosts and Vinh was extremely helpful with anything you need, even be booking you a taxi and getting up with you at 3:30 in the morning and explain the taxi driver the shortest way to the airport.\r\n",
      "It was a great and perfect final stay during my 5 week Australian trip.... Thank you soooo much... Can't recommened you enough and will visit and stay with you when i will travel oncemore again in Australia and visit Sydney......Die Unterkunft ist so wie beschrieben. Es hat alles sehr gut geklappt.Vinh und Stuart sind sehr gute Gastgeber. Die Wohnung liegt sehr zentral in Sydney. Alles sehr ordentlich und sauber. Auf jeden Fall weiter zu empfehlen. Grüße Cornelia. We had a wonderful stay at Stuart and VInh's gorgeous house. They are both such lovely people and very welcoming.  The house is beautiful and our bedroom was spacious. \r\n",
      "Great location, walking distance to Darling Harbour, and the bus stop is right outside the back. \r\n",
      "We would highly recommend staying here, and will defiantly look to stay here again ourselves if we come back to Sydney. \r\n",
      "Kenji the dog is adorable, loves fuss and has cool haircuts :-) Everything was great. Especially the feeling to be as free as you like. In other words: it felt like being home. Thanks!We stayed with Vinh and Stuart for 4 Nights. They have a lovely home and a very cute puppy. The location is absolutely great, within 15 minutes of walking we were in the heart of Sydney.Wer enjoyed staying with Vinh and Stuart. They were very friendly and gave us useful advice on Sydney. The room and bathroom were very clean. \r\n",
      "We had a wonderful time in Sydney and would stay with Vinh & Stuart again in a heart beat.We enjoyed your hospitality. Thank you!Myself and Henry had a lovely time in Sydney, mostly because of the accommodation that we stayed at. Very convenient location and Vinh is a very friendly and lovely host. Kenji - adorable dog, was a cherry on the cake. We will definitely return when we get the chance to fly to Sydney again. Thanks for making us feel welcomed and at home!We enjoyed staying at Vinh and Stuart's place a lot. Having breakfast (continetal breakfast with coffee and fresh fruit provided) in the terrace with harbour view was especially nice. The location is within walking distance to the CBD, and a good public transport connection for those not too much into walking. Both rooms they have to offer are nice, the one on the first floor being somewhat bigger, but the attic one having a harbor view. Note the attic room does not have the door (better choose the room on the first floor if you are concerned), but it has a private staircase entrance which provides enough privacy. All in all, a lovely house in a convenient location, and Vinh and Stuart were extremely helpful and friendly hosts, we would certainly like to come back some day!Vinh+Stuart were wonderful hosts to us ,it was like staying with family that we have known for years ,\r\n",
      "We were treated very well and Vinh was extremely helpful to  and very very kind to us it was a real pleasure to stay with them , and would certainly return to them if i go to Sydney again .\r\n",
      "Thank you Vinh and Stuart for everything .This is a lovely home in a great location. Vinh was ever helpful and friendly, while still allowing us our space. We didn't meet Stuart until the day we left, but he also was helpful. \r\n",
      "The room is big enough, good sized actually for a room in a narrow terrace house. Everything we could have wanted was provided and we enjoyed staying with Vinh and Stuart very much. We particularly enjoyed breakfast in the paving outside overlooking the water of Sydney harbour. This is our second time in airbnb! The location is very good! Easy to go to darling Harbour and fish market! The view from house is also great! The house is beautiful, we all have good memory in this house! I will book this again if I have chance next time! \n",
      "This was our first time using Airbnb and it will not be our last.\r\n",
      "Stuart and Vinh made us so welcome and comfortable, nothing was too much trouble.\r\n",
      "I feel that we have made a new set of friends, we talked about so many things on so many levels and when we eventually go back to Sydney and the guys are still there we would stop with them no questions asked !\r\n",
      "The facilities are great, the house is great and in a perfect location.\r\n",
      "If you stay with them for 4 or more days then listen when they recommend getting a weeks travel card, it really will save you a fortune.....I thought I knew better and spent a fortune !\r\n",
      "Stay here you won't regret it.Vinh and Stuart were wonderful hosts! They greeted us with a big smile and gave us lots of helpful advice and insight into Sydney. The house was extremely well kept and the location was very convenient. It was absolutely lovely to stay with them!This was my first Airbnb experience and Vinh and Stuart made me feel very welcome. Vinh was very patient, helpful and they have a beautiful and spacious home located in a super central location in Sydney. We also talked in length about each other's businesses. I would high recommend staying with Vinh and Stuart when you are in Sydney. For me, it beats any hotels in the city (which are usually tiny) by a long shot!Vinh & Stuart were the most incredible hosts - nothing was too much and they made us feel so welcome in their home.  We travelled with hand luggage only, so they were kind enough to offer us beach towels to use and even sunscreen! The coffee in the morning was also VERY welcome!!\r\n",
      "The room is beautiful - it had aircon and even our own balcony!   Their house is easy to get to from the airport, and a short work to the lovely Darling Harbour.   What can I say - if you come to Sydney... stay with these guys!!We had a wonderful time at Vinh and Stu's beautiful house. It's a great location and the house has bags of charm. I enjoyed sitting on their beautiful terrace looking out onto the harbour, drinking their delicious coffee. Vinh and Stu were so hospitable and friendly, next time I'm back in Sydney, I'd definitely want to stay here.My mum and I had a fantastic holiday and absolutely loved Sydney, it is a fantastic city!  Vinh and Stuart were lovely people and we really enjoyed our stay with them.  They were incredibly helpful and offered lots of great advice.  They also sorted a taxi for us on the day we left so we could get back to the airport.  The house was comfortable and clean and we were made to feel very welcome.  We also loved Kenji the dog who was very friendly and extremely cute!  I highly recommend Vinh and Stuart and we hope to return to Sydney again one day.  We absolutely loved staying with Vinh, Stuart and Kenji!  They were so friendly and welcoming of us into their home and gave us some great advice on where to eat and what to see. Their home and the room we stayed in was beautiful, clean and fully equipped - they even had umbrellas for us to borrow when it rained! Their home is in such a convenient location that we walked everywhere, although there was public transport very close by too. We would highly recommend a stay with them and hope we get the opportunity to stay there again too. We had a fantastic time staying with Vinh and Stuart in their beautiful house. It's a great location for exploring Sydney, and Vinh and Stuart are the perfect hosts, friendly, helpful and informative. It was a great start to our honeymoon! Our stay with Vinh and Stuart in Sydney was lovely. The house is not large but definitely big enough for the two of us and the room was quite roomy as well. The views from the backyard are lovely as well good for sitting outside and enjoying the view. The house is also very clean and they provided everything you need. Met Vinh when we arrived who was very welcoming and helpful. The house is a little bit out of the city but it was still central enough a nice walk into the city centre - though the hill on the way back some days was a bit tiring but good exercise after all the eating. I would definitely recommend staying here if you ever go to Sydney.Staying at Vinh + Stuart's completely surpassed our expectations! Their warmth, generosity and kindness is obvious from the moment you walk through the door - and Kenji is the cutest little dog. Everything is well organised for guests, the bed is super comfy, little conveniences like toiletries and towels are thoughtfully available. They respect your space and privacy, but are always available for chats and suggestions on places to visit in Sydney. It really felt like we were catching up with friends despite meeting for the first time! The neighbourhood is in a fantastic location at the fringe of the city - five minutes walk to Star casino, bus stop just down the street to head into the city, an easy ten-minute walk to cafes (Vinh has great foodie recommendations), and a gorgeous waterfront park for jogs (although we were too comfy in bed to actually do this...). Missing Sydney to bits and would stay with Vinh + Stuart + Kenji again, no doubt about it.This was a fabulous stay. Vinh met us warmly and invited us into his home. It was a lovely stay - centrally located to all that we needed, comfortable and spacious room complete with heater.We had a wonderful time in Vinh & Stuarts beautiful home. They are both excellent hosts and gave us good advice on stuff to do and see. Even though we didn´t see them that much, communication was always easy and fast. The location of the house is great, close to the water and a small park. It´s also in good walking distance to the city. Kenji, their cute dog, is super friendly and very well behaved. Thank you all 3 of you for having us!Vinh and Stuart are perfect hosts. We had by far our best stay at their place. They were really helpful with advice for everything we needed. Furthermore they´re always good for a chat, however they respected our space and privacy. Their little dog Kenji is so cute and he`s always good for a cuddle. Thank you guys for having us staying at your place and bringing our stay in Sydney down to a round figure!Vinh & Stuart\r\n",

The house,  bedroom and amenities were spotless and the location is amazing:  2min stroll to a 24hr city bus,  5min walk to the tram, 10min walk to Darling Harbour, 30min walk to the city Centre.  We would recommend Vinh and Stuart's place to friends and family without hesitation. Thanks for your hospitality!Thanks for having us Vinh & Stuart! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My second stay at Pyrmont. Couldn't recommend nicer hosts. Always incredibly hospitable and accommodating. Again, staying at their's whilst in Sydney for work makes it a much warmer, homely experience than staying in a hotel. Hope to see you again,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the best,\r\n",
      "VanessaDrama free place in central Sydney.Staying here was like coming back to a home each night. It was not just a great location (a 15 min walk to Harbourside and 20 min walk to George Street), but it was the ideal getaway. What really made the place perfect was its host, Vinh (unfortunately did not have the opportunity to meet Stuart). He made me feel so welcomed and comfortable within seconds of meeting. So very knowledgeable and always willing to help. \r\n",

      "These guys are truly one-of-a-kind and certainly are the best hosts you'll ever meet. My only regret is not having more time to spend at this amazing place! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Top marks! I really enjoyed my stay at Vinh and Stuart's place.  The location was the best (very close to the city, and public transportation) and the house had its own view of the Sydney bay.  It was a joy walking out of the door and see the beautiful prymont neighborhood.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Both Vihn and Stuart were very kind and friendly - they are genuine and good people.  I also loved Kenji!!! He was so adorable :)   I would come back and stay here again!!! Vinh was a wonderful host - charming, interesting and attentive to our needs (regretfully, we didn't have much of a chance to meet Stuart). Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet, and the location was great -- we mostly traveled by foot, with only the odd bus. It was great to be able to use the kitchen too -- we made dinner at 'home' one night, which was a nice break from eating out all the time. We also had access to the washing machine and a dryer/ drying rack, which was really helpful. Though it was a little chilly at night, we had a heater in our room, which was appreciated on a couple of particularly chilly evenings/mornings. Vinh even arranged for our cab to the airport and got up early on a Sunday morning to see us off! Vinh and stuart are excellent hosts! Vinh was exceptionally helpful and provided me medication when I fell sick on vacation :( Location is really convenient, light tram less than 5mins walk away. Highly recommended! Oh and I miss their cute little furkid Kenji!! :)如果只是给这里评价“很好很舒适位置也超棒房主特别热情”  这样我会觉得是没有感情的 \n",
      "虽然只有两晚 可Vinh和Stuart 给我太多的感动和感慨 冬天的悉尼气温连上海的深秋都赶不上 但是晚上还是稍许有些寒意的 可当我们回到“家”时 房间里的暖气和空调早就已经为我们打开 一屋子的温暖不仅赶走了身上的寒意 连心里那一丝丝的思乡也被赶跑 还有好多这样的小小的举动 但却大大的让我感动到不行 谢谢你们 亲爱的Vinh & Stuart  你们让我觉得好温暖Thanks to Vinh and Stuart for a perfect stay. The house was clean and well appointed, and the location--overlooking the water--stunning as described. Vinh and Stuart were friendly, welcoming and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this listing.The moment we arrived Vinh made us feel comfortable just like old friends. Vinh and Stuart's cute and cosy little terrace house is in such a terrific location.  Public transport is at the doorstep (front or back door) if/when we needed but we walked everywhere because there are so many scenic walks around to explore.  Vinh gave us many tips not only where to go, how to get there but also the background/history of some of the places.  A walk from Pirrama park to the Fish market is very interesting.  Having a nice clean warm place to 'come home' to everyday and being treated like old friends have played such an important part of our memorable weekend.  Breakfast was light and easy, coffee was great. Our stay with Vinh and Stuart was our first Airbnb and we are so glad to have shared that experience with them.  We have already told friends to stay with Vinh & Stuart when they visit Sydney. We will certainly want to stay with Vinh and Stuart again in the future. Thank you so much for sharing your lovely warm home with us. Our stay with Vinh and Stuart was fantastic. They have a beautiful and clean home, and our room was cozy and comfortable. The perks for me were definitely the  views of the water in the morning while enjoying a cup of coffee, and the fish market just around the corner! And of course our friendly and hospitable hosts. The location is also pretty good. Walking to the city is a bit of a hike if you walk (30-40 minutes), but if you catch the 443 bus it's not long at all. Overall, I will definitely try to stay with them again the next time I'm in Sydney.If you like roaming the streets of Sydney, this place is at a perfect location! Pyrmont is a fun neighbourhoud on it's own with lots of little café's and restaurants. Darling Harbour is only a 10 min walk. In order to fight the jetlag and soak up some much needed sunlight we walked from the house to The Rocks: a very nice walk along the water.\r\n",
      "The house itself is charming, the room we stayed in is big enough for 2+luggage and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom is downstairs, tucked in between the livingroom and the kitchen. It is also very small and we had to share it with 2 other guests, which lead to a bit of a waiting game. The good news was that the bathroom was stacked with soap to wash away the feeling you get after a 14hr flight!\r\n",
      "Breakfast was okay: there was a choice of cereal and/or bread and different sorts of jam/peanut butter. Very good coffee and tea made for a good start of the day. \r\n",
      "Vinh is kind and accomodating. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Stuart. Their little dog is cute. All in all a good place to be if you are visiting Sydney. :)Nice hosts who made us (Email hidden by Airbnb) fy room and loved the kitchen facilities especially the coffee machine.\r\n",
      "Many thanks for the kind hosting.Loved my stay! Room was large and private, location is an easy bus trip (10mins) to the city and Vinh is both a great host and perfect contact for creatives looking to connect with the scene in Sydney. 房东非常好,随和,知识渊博｡每一位房客到了,房东都会很认真的给房客讲解厨房等电器的使用方法,很有耐心｡在悉尼住了3晚,感觉跟在家一样,很温馨｡\r\n",

Good coffee and yummy fruit bread for our breakfast was perfect. I could have chatted to them both all day too! Thanks for having us!As a first time user of Airbnb, this was a great experience.  From the moment of first contact to the detailed instructions and warm welcome, Stuart and Vinh made my visit smooth and trouble-free.  It was wonderful to stay in a homely environment rather than an impersonal hotel room.Perfect 4 nights stay in Sydney with Vinh & Stuart.  This is my second time staying with them.

House and room was quite comfortable and Vinh was really good host and guide for us. Thank you so much Vinh, hope to see you again and Sydney.A fantastic time staying with Vinh and Stuart, lovely home very central, we walked everywhere as nothing was too far away. Vinh greeted us when we arrive and took us through everything and was helpful on giving us lots of info where to go for eating out and all the sites. Plus they have the most cutest dog! Thanks for being great hosts. Great hospitality in a beautiful and central location in Sydney! Loved Kenji (the cute Pomerian dog). We would highly recommend this accommodation to friends and family.When I arrived I was made to feel really welcome and immediately felt very comfortable there. Just like home from home. Vinh and Stuart are great Hosts and if I return to Sydney I  would love to stay there again. The accommodation is in a great position to visit all,the sights plus Pyrmount is a great place to explore. A little gem Vinh and Stuart were very welcoming and accommodating! They made us feel like family. We requested in advance for an early check in and they were OK with this.  When we checked in and checked out, Vinh was very helpful in getting our luggage up and down his steps.  Their home was stocked with fresh fruit, toast, tea and coffee that we were able to use at our leisure.  As well as accessibility to use their washer/dryer.  This definitely was a plus! I appreciated their help and tips in getting around, this location is perfect.  It's near everything and if you get tired of walking, there is a bus located just outside their front steps. I can see why they get booked up, they are wonderful hosts!Awesome home in a great location, the very early check in was much appreciated! Vinh was there to meet us in the afternoon and showed us how to work the Aldi coffee machine! Place was pretty close to what was advertised.Fantastic place to stay right in the heart of everything that Sydney has to offer.  Vinh was very welcoming and flexible with our check in and check out times. Lots of places to eat within walking distance and Vinh's recommendations were very useful. Bed was very comfortable and it was a great bonus having the air con in the room. We would love to stay here again when we are next in Sydney.Vinh and Stuart were amazing hosts and their place was in great location. They were very helpful and excellent to deal with. Thanks heapsVinh met us on arrival. He was really welcoming and accommodating. We were given a tour of the house, facilities and our room. Both Vinh and Stuart were really helpful with guidance with what to do in Sydney. They made us feel right at home.\r\n",

      "The neighbourhood felt very safe and friendly. We really couldn't have had a better trip. Thank you Vinh and Stuart xxVinh and Stuart were great host! They were very informative about the city, told me where to get souvenirs at a cheap price and how to explore the city to the fullest. I could get everywhere just by walking, it might be a far walk but I enjoy walking! I would certainly stay with Vinh and Stuart again! The location is a really great starting point to discover the city - you can either walk or take the bus right outside the house. The room was cozy and the kitchen fully equiped. All was clean and you have your own bathroom downstairs. When we had any questions, both were very helpful. Thanks again! Our 3 day stay with Vihn and Stuart (hosts) was very enjoyable - their home is very comfortable with everything we required/expected.  Our room was charming and the rear courtyard with a view of the Pyrmont water-front offered an option to enjoy our breakfast (or an afternoon beverage) in the sunshine.\r\n",
      "With the listing being only a 5 minute walk to the Light-Rail, Sydney/ CBD is on your doorstep.\r\n",
      "We would certainly recommend  this accommodation to our friends, with our stay made all the more enjoyable by our charming (but not intrusive) hosts and we will look forward to another stay in the future.     Judy & KeithThanks to Vinh and Stuart for a lovely short stay. The house was clean and tidy with all the usual amenities, wifi etc. The location was easy to find. There's loads of public transport nearby but I was more than happy walking (appox 30 minutes to the CBD). The casino is just around the corner too! Vinh was very friendly and more than happy to answer any questions I had about the city, restaurants and local area. I'd definitely stay again.Vinh and Stuart were really accommodating with my last minute request to stay in their lovely home. Really close to the city but right near the water, it was a perfect combination of being able to relax in the city and feel at home. I had a great stay!We were made to feel very welcome by Vinh (and Stuart- but we only saw him briefly). Their house is lovely and had everything we needed. Their neighbourhood is nice and quiet, but in a very convenient location - only 10 min walk from Pyrmont Bridge, the aquarium, maritime museum etc. From there you can easily walk to most attractions around the city. We would definitely ask to stay with Vinh and Stuart again if we went back to Sydney. Vinh and Stuart are great hosts and their place is lovely, clean and equipped with all the necessities like towels, toiletries etc. The place is very near  to The Star and only walking  distance to the light rail or bus stop to the city. Definitely recommended to airbnb at their place. It was a happy and comfort stay. All necessary facilities, easy access.\r\n",
      "Location is great. I love the riverside park the backyard (garden) overlooks. Buses close by covers most destination in city. And if you like, walking distance from Darling Harbour. The host Vinh was also friendly and ready to help!Vinh&Stuart are fantastic hosts ,we had a great stay in their beautiful terrace house million$ views and 5 star hospitality , so kind and accommodating . Many thanks we would love to stay again .❤️We had a very warm welcome. Vinh was there to explain everything in the house and give us the key.\r\n",
      "Stuart and Vinh are really open for meeting new people. We could share our interest and discover all their activities: very rich moment.\r\n",
      "The house is located 10-15 minutes walk from the city center with all facilities and interesting points. We also used the bus across the street.\r\n",
      "The room was enjoyable, confortable and clean.\r\n",
      "We nearly felt home!Vinh and Stuart are great. The apartment is nicely situated in the harbour area, making it convenient to travel to anywhere in Sydney. The apartment is neat and tidy and you can enjoy everything in the fridge for free, milk, bread and jelly etc. Vinh is warm-hearted and willing to offer his sincere suggestions. My friend and I had a great time staying with V&S. Vinh and Stuart were excellent hosts. They were quick to respond to any questions before arrival and made us feel really welcomed while we stayed at their place. The location was really convinient and close to all of Sydney's major attractions. I definitely recommend staying at this location. Thank you for hospitality. We enjoyed staying with you and appreciated the close proximity to Darling Harbour.Vinh & Stuart made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived, with a guided tour of the premises, a quick chat about coffee (very important!) and a kindly provided parking pass so that we could park our car for free on the street outside. The room and facilities were spotless and very comfortable. I would recommend their accomodation without any hesitation! Thanks Vinh and Stuart!Vinh and Stuart are excellent hosts with good local knowledge and a very well located home. They are very welcoming, helpful and accommodating, (and have an extremely cute dog!), and the room is comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay in Sydney with Vinh and Stuart, thanks guys!Vinh, Stuart and Kenji :) were most welcoming.  Their home is the first in the street of refurbished old dock worker's houses.  The room is in front/road facing and yet, very quiet.  The room is spacious, bright and clean with just enough wardrobe space. Vinh and Stuart do really practice \"our home is your home\" - we had use of their kitchen to make simple meals or have a drink. Their home is a comfortable 15-20min walk to the CBD via the Pyrmont Bridge.  I had a really nice stay here! The location is so great - easily walkable to everyone with a spectacular harbor view just a couple minutes walk away. Vinh and stuarts place was absolutly lovely and we had a great stay. The room was comfortable and the house was neat and tidy. They were very helpful and kind and we would recomend their place to other travelers.Vinh and Stuart's place is a convenient place to hang out in Sydney, with bus stops and the light rail station a simple 3-4 min stroll from their doorstep.  If you're traveling with heavy luggage that you'd rather not spend extra energy or effort, a cab costs $40 (at night w/o much traffic) and up to $60 (in the day with moderate traffic). If you're content to spend some quiet mornings in the area, Pyrmont offers enough coffee shops, cafes and good eats to keep you happy. Otherwise, a quick 10-15min ride into the city is available on the 443.  If you'd rather walk, the Star casino is 5mins away and the rest of the harbours well within reach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I found their place cosy and peaceful. While their place is quite near the street, it isn't noisy save for the few passing voices that come by the mostly serene residential area. Stuart and Vinh open their home readily and we are welcome to use the wifi, kitchen or laundry available in their home. There are separate bathrooms which preserve a sense of privacy between host and guest, though bathrooms are not ensuite. \r\n",

      "In short, an enjoyable time! Stuart and Vinh were gracious hosts even though we probably saw very little of one another. Nevertheless, they met me when I first arrived and offered suggestions of what to do/where to go. They're just nice guys who hope you enjoy your stay - their offer to call me a cab for the morning I left was a sweet gesture! Vinh greeted us on arrival and showed us where everything we needed would be - our room, fully equipped kitchen, bathroom, and of course coffee! and Kenji! who could forget Kenji- cute dog! :-) \r\n",
      "The house is very nice and everything looks as it does in the pictures. Perfect location for exploring Sydney, walking distance from everything you might need for an escape! Great value for moneyOur stay with Vinh+Stuart was spectacular. The location was perfect for us as it's very close to the city. We can see the harbour bridge from the street and there's a nice park right at the back of the house. The room has enough heating system that kept us warm during the winter season. The room, including the bathroom were very clean. There were fruits and snacks for the guests and very good coffee too. Vinh was very warm and accommodating who gave us good suggestions in touring the city. He was very kind to spend some time to chat with us despite his busy schedule. We highly recommend his place.We had a great stay with Vinh and Stuart. Their home was lovely and very close to the city. On arriving we met Vinh who was very welcoming and showed us everything we needed. As Stuart was away on business we only met him briefly but Vinh was great and advised us on public transport etc, but we walked everywhere as it was all so close.  Vinh was also happy to advise us on things to do and his knowledge of the area was really helpful! We had a great stay at Vinh and Stuart's place and felt right at home. We would definitely stay again, highly recommended! Real nice hosts. Real nice house in Sydney. It's cold when we arrive at Sydney. But Vinh and Stuart 's house is warm. Our room and the bathroom are tidy and decorated. Vinh introduced Sydney to us, food, place to go, et. The lovely dog kenji is friendly and quiet. The traffic there is really good. We can walk to fish market and darling harbor in less than 20minutes. It's a wonderful experience in AU.Lovely place to stay - I'm very happy I chose it.\r\n",

Their home is in a fantastic location-everything you need is within reach but its still quiet enough to be relaxing! I really appreciated the guys' hosting style-they were friendly,welcoming and helpful without being overbearing-a difficult skill to master! House was spotless and has everything you need.

      "Okay - Room was AirBnB average, location close enough to walk 1.5 miles to the main action areas around Circular Quey and The Rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so Good - thought price a bit high ($20) as better locations IMO after visiting Sydney for tourists are around Central Station or just north towards Circular Quey,Chinatown, Darling Harbour or The Rocks.  If I visit again, I will look in those areas as not only feel better location for tourist, but were about $20 per night cheaper for similar quality. There neighborhood seems great for locals to live, close, but not too close to the city as well as main tourist area.Thanks lads. Very easy, and seamless stay over the weekend. Will keep you guys in mind next I'm in Sydney. Cheers.As our flight arrived early in the morning Vinh and Stuart allowed us to drop our suitcases off before checking in so that we could go shopping without having to drag our suitcases around.    The neighbour hood was great.  There are beautiful views of the water within minutes of their place.  There are lots of apartments in the neighbourhood.  I was delighted to find a beauty shop just around the corner so I could have some waxing done.  The location is fantastic and Vinh and Stuart are very friendly and helpful.Amazing place in a great location. The room was really comfy and the whole house really nice. The district is really nice and you can walk down to the CBD in 15 - 20 minutes. The kitchen was fully equipped, the fridge always full and Vinh & Stuart were very welcoming. Vinh even got up at three in the morning to make sure the taxi he had called for us was really coming to pick us up! We can definitely recommend this place! This was the second time we stayed with Vinh and Stuart.\r\n",
      "They are great hosts and the house and room are comfortable.\r\n",
      "They are experienced hosts and are well equipped.I really enjoyed staying at Vinh & Stuart's home. They are lovely guys and know how to be social while also giving you space. They've put in a lot of thought so everything in the house that you need is at your fingertips. It's a great space in a terrific part of Sydney, and I do recommend.\r\n",
      "Vinh and Stuart made me feel very welcome in their home and provided lots of information on things to do in Sydney and the best way to get around using the transit system. Their home is in a great location only a short bus ride to Circular Quay which is close to many of the big attractions in Sydney (the Opera House, the Royal Botanical Gardens and the Rocks district). You could easily get buses or ferries from there to wherever else you wanted to explore as well :). I also loved meeting Kenji :) What a sweet little pup! Thanks again for your hospitality!It's an amazing experience to live in Vinh&Staurt's house, clean room and convenient position. And the hosts are very warm-heart. They give us some valuable suggestions about visiting Sydney. By the way, there's a lovely dog. My wife loves it so much. But unfortunately we forget it's name.... I recommend this house, and I prefer to live here if I travel to Sydney again:)I really LOVE their cute dog!! Vinh is really nice to show us how to get everywhere. And the house is really close to the darling harbor and shopping mall. The only little problem is the washroom is too simple for four girls XD.Smooth as silk. Really appreciated Vinh and Stuart's comfortable home and their tips about the local are. These guys have experience and it shows. Thoughtful, professional, orderly. Thanks, I would stay again.I stayed at this property whilst on business in Sydney. I particularly enjoyed chatting with Stuart and meeting Kenji, a very well behaved dog. The room is spacious, the bed comfortable and the stairs not too steep to negotiate. I very much appreciated Stuart's help with my suitcase on arrival and departure. The bathroom was very clean. The location is great for getting into the city and beyond as it is 2 minutes walk from the light rail. I loved the proximity to the harbour especially the deck out from the kitchen overlooking the water. There are some very good cafes and restaurants in the area which are reasonably priced with excellent food. I recommend this establishment to others.Vinh phoned to be sure, that we arrived as forseen and received us very friendly in his and his friend's Stuart home. He informed us about the local traffic and gave us the'opal' tickets for transportation.\r\n",
      "Further he asked us what we wanted to do in S. and advised us what best to do and when.Safe and quiet neighborhood, with a sunny outlook across the water. This property is a 2 minute walk to Star Casino and a further 5 minutes to all the entertainment of Darling Harbour. Lots of quaint little restaurants in the immediate vicinity also. Kenji  doesn't bark ever and is the cutest little doggie. Stuart and Vinh were excellent hosts and hardly ever home, so there's plenty of privacy if you desire that. They have a couple of Opal cards for guests to use on public transport, so we only had to top up ($10 min) to use the light rail and buses that were nearby. Will stay again and recommend to our friends. Glen and Karen.Beautiful place, excellent location and welcoming hosts.  One of the best airbnb accommodations we've stayed over the years. Just want to say again thank you Vinh and Stuart for hosting us for a weekend!It is quite pleasant to stay there. The location is quite good,close to many place like fish market and darling harbour. There's very good view from the small yard of the house. Thanks a lot, Vinh & Stuart!Great hosts, although i didn't get the opportunity to spend much time there it was fine to be ships that passed in the night and they truly open up their home as hosts.Vinh and Stuart are very welcoming. They take care of all your small concerns. We had amazing time staying with them.Great hosts, great location...perfect stay!  Thanks Vinh + Stuart.My hosts Vinh and Stuart made me feel incredibly welcome. Stuart saved my bacon by giving me a pack of study cards for my speech, which made the world of difference. And swapping stories about our mutual interest in the arts and creative industries made me feel a part of things. Kenji, the dog is a delightful welcomer too! The accommodation was lovely and location perfect for a Sydney visit - close to everything and quiet and peaceful. I look forward to visiting again in the near future.We really enjoyed our stay - the room was extremely comfortable and we would definitely stay again. Vinh and Stuart were very welcoming and we really appreciated their tips on where to eat out in the neighbourhood. Kenji didn't say much, but he liked his tummy rubbed! :) The availability of a light breakfast was a nice touch.房東很nice~地理位置也很方便,去坐light rail走5分鐘就到了!!就是晚上有點吵~估計是醉漢在大聲喧嘩Vinh was very accommodating from the beginning. Just completed a six day stay at Vinh and Stuart's house, from the moment of arrival we were made to feel welcome and comfortable, Vinh did a great job and was an excellent source of info for the city which is literally on the doorstep. Outstanding location to see Sydney on foot, no car required. This was our first use of Airbnb, and we were suitably impressed to the point that we are considering becoming hosts ourselves when we return home. Thanks VInh and Stuart, have a good Christmas, look us up if you visit the uk. Bev and Jon.Vinh & Stuart's place was great! Very close to Darling Harbor and the train network. Their dog is so sweet and very quiet, and Vinh was so helpful in recommending places to check out. I'd recommend them to anyone needing a place to stay in Sydney! Vinh and Stuart are really really great hosts! We could use everything in their kitchen and the room was really nice, clean and comfertable! The location was also perfect on walking distance to the center (30 min walk) no need for bustickets etc! They also helped us finding a nice spot for NYE and where to go after Sydney! We want to go to Sydney again and we would love to stay here again!My mum and I had a great stay at Vinh and Stuart's. We were welcomed warmly and of course we fell in love with their cute little dog Kenji!! :) \n",

      "Both Vinh & Stuart are a warm & hospitable person which made my stay at their place enjoyable, they provide me with useful information about the city & local's insight about both must-visit & must-see attraction in Sydney.

Vinh was really helpful ordering taxis and giving us information about the city. vintage house with so many book collections. large bay view porch perfect for breakfast. lovely and tame dog reminds me of my hometown pet. warm host Vinh considerable in every aspect.房子地理位置很不错,是临近city的一个区,步行去city大概20分钟左右,沿途风景也不错,离鱼市场很近｡房间安静,较宽敞,厨房设备齐全,就是洗手间在一楼不是很方便｡Vinh很nice,只呆了两天,聊的不多,但需要时给了不少建议和帮忙,而且还会讲粤语和普通话,沟通非常方便｡(没看到Stuart)Exactly as advertised - great hosts with great and comfortable room.  Definitely will try to come back again one day!!  Thanks guys for a lovely stay!    Vinh and Stuart were very welcoming and accomodating to our early arrival. \r\n",

They have a cute little dog who might join you for breakfast if your first up in the morning and I had such a great time in Sydney being so close to Darling Harbour and the general city area. I didn't spend much time outside of when I was sleeping at the house but having the freedom to come and go and not worry about keys or them being home/awake made my days out that much easier. Would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat!\r\n",

Will definitely stay again when in Sydney for work.Perfect Sydney location!  Walkable to the city and a great suburb with wonderful restaurants  and fish market!  We were especially appreciative that Vinh and Stuart invited us to join a session for entrepreneurs at their CoSydney co-working business, art gallery, and coffee shop.  The talk was inspiring and one of the highlights of our Sydney visit.  Vinh and Stuart were very friendly and welcoming and I had a really nice stay at their place. The house is comfortable and well situated in a nice suburb and in walking distance to the main spots in the city. Would definitely recommend them to friends :-) Vinh and Stuart went above and beyond what was expected from my first airbnb experience. From full use of their house, the beautifully decorated bedroom with its own balcony, and all the amenities you could ever need. Even on the last day, we slept in and they were very gracious about it. Would recommend to all travelling to Sydney!Vinh and Stuart have an awesome place in a fantastic location. My wife and I were there for 5 days and the guys really made us feel like we were at home. You can walk into the city in 15 mins, but don't rush through Pyrmont too quickly, because the cafes and parks are incredible.\n",

I will stay with them again when in Sydney next. Great location, clean and tidy room, well thought-out accommodation with a real home feel. Thanks Vinh and Stuart.We really enjoyed the location of Stuart and Vinh's lovely house. Pyrmont has a great selection of cafes for brunch and coffee, and the city centre is an easy stroll away. Their house is exactly as described in the listing. Stuart and Vinh were friendly and accommodating.  I felt welcome by being provided with an email shortly before my arrival confirming that I would be able to drop my luggage early - as opposed to the check-in time of 6pm listed on their site. This was incredibly helpful to me as an older single traveler.  The bedroom and bathroom were clean, the bed was comfortable, and I felt welcome to use the kitchen space.  Vinh and Stuart are sociable but allow you to have your own space as well.We loved our experience at Vinh and Stuart's. The Pyrmont location is great with lots of restaurants nearby. The room was spacious and clean. We had nice conversations with both Vinh and Stuart who are both very helpful with recommendations.Vinh and Stuart were very kind and charismatic hosts.  We appreciated their kindness and patience, especially when we arrived late and experienced some miscommunication with our arrival time.  The process of getting settled in was seamless and comfortable.  The house is beautiful and in s great location.  Vinh and Stuart also had plenty of resources/information for traveling and let us have free reign of the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was like being with roommates.  Thanks again for your hospitality and kindness! This is a lovely place to stay, Stuart and Vinh were super accommodating (letting us leave our bags etc) and helpful. Communication was easy and the room is really comfortable. From start to finish this was an easy and seamless booking. This was our first experience using Airbnb and we are so glad we picked such great hosts. The description of the property is spot on, the house is clean and you are made feel at home. I didn't realise how close this place is to everything. Within walking distance to casino and darling harbour or catch the light rail into the markets.

      "Thank you so much for your hospitality.The host was there to greet me when I arrived, warm friendly welcome and good introduction to the property and what was available. Helpful about any information required. The property is in easy walking distance of Darling Harbour and the city, public transport also very easy to use and access from the property.  Really easy stay, felt safe even walking around at night by myself.Two very comfortable nights.  The room was just right for our short stay - super comfy bed and we spent a lazy late arvo sipping cocktails and reading on our own verandah.  The bathroom was spotless and the small terrace house is a lovely brisk 15 minute walk from Darling Harbour.  Vinh was most welcoming and not intrusive at all.  If you have time, walk along the foreshore path to Sydney Fish Market for lunch.  Took us about 40 minutes to get there.I had a great time here. Stuart and Vinh provided everything that was required to make me comfortable, down to the unexpected hairdryer, bread, fruit and tips for getting around. A beautiful place.Stuart and Vinh were very responsive and easy to communicate with. Check in and out were super convenient and the location was superb! Would definitely recommend a stay here I had a good time staying at this place. The location is very convenient and close to great restaurants and Darling Harbour. The place is good although the bathroom, being downstairs is a bit inconvenient, specially with more guests. Overall good!Stuart和Vinh都特别友好,我和朋友到了之后Stuart就和我们介绍家里的情况,家附近389路公交车和轻轨L1号线路特别方便,想去的地方基本上这两班车都可以包括了｡步行去fish market 和darling harbour都是十来分钟的路程｡地理位置绝了｡可以买一张opal card,会划算很多,周日不管坐多少次车只要2.5刀,一周内坐满了八次之后也可以免费｡Vinh会说中文和粤语,所以英语不好的朋友也不用太担心,太开心自己运气好选择了了这个房子Vinh was welcoming and willing to help out with suggestions for our stay.

Nice location and kitchen set up.Very friendly and welcoming hosts.My colleague and I enjoyed our brief stay with Vinh & Stuart... and Kenji. =) They were really friendly, amiable and respectful of giving us as much space and quietness as we wanted.

      "The fridge was well stocked (except vegemite... hee hee) with bread, butter, jam, and we had good coffee and tea selection! Oh yes we had a good selection of cereal too. (Love wheatbix) Where else can you get such fantastic homeliness away from home and in a foreign country?\r\n",

      "Amenities aside, the house is a home and it gives out good vibes. This is mostly due to Vinh and Stuart themselves. Thank you so much for hosting us and giving us a chance to stay with you, vinh & Stuart (&Kenji). =) We will definitely recommend this place to our loved ones. \r\n",

      "Staying with Stuart and Vinh was very enjoyable. Stuart was there to greet us the evening we arrived and helped us with our luggage. He gave us the tour and made us feel very welcome. Unfortunately, we didn't see much of him after this as we were out most of the day into the evenings. We did however have the pleasure of meeting Vinh, who is equally as lovely. We had rented the second bedroom (not the loft) in their gorgeous home. The room was clean and tidy, and they had provided us with towels, which was very handy. The bathroom was again, very clean and well kept. \n",
      "The house is in an excellent location and is just a short walk from Sydney's Light Rail system. It's also within walking distance of Darling Harbour, and very near other attractions like the Star casino. \n",
      "We were encouraged to make ourselves feel like we were at home from the very beginning, and that's what it felt like. I'd highly recommend booking with these hosts - you won't regret it. My boyfriend and I spent 4 nights at Vinh's and Stuart's place and enjoyed it very much. Our hosts were  laid back and very friendly so that we felt very much at ease. Vinh was very helpful in giving us all kind of information about Sydney and helped us calling a taxi for our departure. The cosy little house is very much like old houses in England.  The windows hardly keep any sound off, but as it is a quiet and very nice area of Sydney,  this was no problem.  The rooms were nicely furnished and tidy. The use of the kitchen was included. What we appreciated very much was, that we could help ourselves to some breakfast including toasts, cereals and coffee. The location was close to Darling harbour where buses to various directions leave.  Pyrmont Bay where the ferry stops is close by. We can highly recommend this place.This was my first time using Air bnb & my experience at Stuart & Vinh's place  certainly did not disappoint. I was greeted upon arrival & shown around the house & how to check in using the PIN system. The room had everything I needed & was a great size. The location is excellent. It is less than 10mins to the CBD & Pyrmont itself is lovely with lots of shops, bars & cafes. During my stay I was away for a few days but was coming back for my last night in Sydney. I was offered a smaller suitcase & told I could leave my luggage in the room whilst I was gone! Stuart & Vinh are very accommodating & go above & beyond what is expected in order to make your stay a good one! Great first experience with Airbnb, nice, safe and accessible to everything! Great location and very welcoming hosts. Was there for 10 days and it was easy to walk or take transit everywhere. So close to the city yet quiet and convenient. The place was perfect for us to crash each night after working long days at the convention center. Great location. Tidy room. Comfy bed. Nice shower. The local restaurants just a short stroll away were all lovely and catered to my vegan eating. Highly recommended. Thanks so much Stuart. Great spot & friendly hosts!  The location was walking distance to just about anything. The area also seemed very safe. It was a wonderful experience!Stu and Vinh were great! Awesome house in a cool neighborhood. Would definitely stay again. We love the house very much, is a home away from home. Stuart&Vinh are 5star host indeed. Extremely convenient home located in a quiet peaceful street. Just a few mins walk away from the light rail, pyrmont, the star etc. We arrived earlier then the allowed check-in time but both Vinh and Stuart were accommodating enough to allow us to check-in way earlier at 11am. We dealt more with Vinh as he was around more often. He is definitely a great host as he was very welcoming and with him being able to speak Cantonese, that made us felt even more at home even though we're in Sydney. He also helped us with carrying our luggage upstairs and giving us some advice on how to go about around town. We didn't get to see Stuart as much but when we did see him, he was constantly checking to make sure that we're doing fine. The place was located strategically as well, since it's just a few minutes walk away from the John Street Square's light rail station. Another plus point, the walk to the city was only about 15-20 minutes away with loads of eateries along the road. All in all, staying at Stuart and Vinh's place had definitely been a great experience. With a prime location, great hospitality and superb view facing the sea at the backyard, this is the place to stay when one goes to Sydney. Will definitely come back the next time around when we drop by for a visit!unfortunately we had to cancel last minute. .. but Vinh and Stuart were a delight to deal with throughout the whole booking process and arranging for our easy arrival.  I'm disappointed we couldn't stay the place seemed amazing and the hosts are fantastic.  thanks guys for your understanding. \n",

      "I can 100% recommend staying at this location. My wife and I stayed at Sydney for 4 days and couldn't have been more satisfied with the place. Both Vinh and Stuart were extremely friendly and super responsive with any questions we had throughout our trip. The place is beautifully decorated and it really felt like home. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Sydeny!I'm happy to meet the two nice guys. The description is exactly the same as what I see. They are happy to share their favourite place nearby. It is recommended for single traveller or couples who would like to explore the city. We had a great stay at Stuart and Vinh's place- plenty of conveniences nearby, comfy bed and excellent wifi signal!Great hosts and prefect location. i was made to feel at home always and even had a quick dinner with Vinh after chatting too long one evening hehe.\n",
      "As they state the stairs up are a bit steep so be careful if you had one too many wines and need to go to bathroom at night because the toilet is on the ground floor and bedroom is on the first.\n",
      "Thanks Guys all the best DavidWe were happy to meet vinh and stuart at their home. We spent a nice time in SydneyBeautiful house in a great location, with friendly welcoming hosts. This was the perfect place for our 5 days in Sydney: excellent value for a charming place in an amazing location with friendly and accommodating hosts. Vinh arranged for us to drop off our bags several hours ahead of their usual 6pm check-in and, as it turned out, was able to be there to welcome us as well, even carrying our bags up the stairs for us (as noted, they are steep and narrow). He also arranged a taxi for our departure. There is so much to do within easy walking or public transit access. And we especially enjoyed having a glass of wine and cheese in the back garden, with its heavenly smelling jasmine and harbor view. We also went to an opening at Vinh and Stuart's gallery--what a treat!We had a wonderful time staying with Vinh and Stuart. The location is brilliant, being a short walk into the city centre and we particularly enjoyed breakfasts in the garden overlooking the water! Vinh and Stuart are very friendly and helpful hosts and their little dog is adorable :)Vinh and Stuart are great Airbnb hosts. Very welcoming and easy to talk to straight from when we first arrived to the house late in the evening. They have everything you need for a short city trip and are brilliantly located in Sydney, a lovely walk to the city centre but tucked away enough to enjoy a quiet nights sleep. I've never had breakfast included in an airbnb but what they provide gives you a good start to your adventures around the city. The other guests at the house added a lovely social community aspect to our stay, and even after we'd checked out we were allowed back to the house to freshen up and change before our flight. Throughly enjoyed our long weekend there, it was like staying at a friend's place rather than an airbnb!Fantastic stay, great location, superb hostsWe had a great time here, as everyone has mentioned I pinch myself for finding this location, it really is excellent....bear in mind when I say that , we walked everywhere so you need to be able to walk a lot. Vinh and Stuart were not around a lot, working guys! but still had time to chat and give suggestions which was wonderful.  Stanley fish market is close so wish I would have found it earlier! Very casual so therefore comfortable and the other guests we met were like minded.....Super séjour, rien à dire. Maison très agréable et bien placée dans sydney.   Stuart et Vinh sont très accueillants et disponibles pour tout type d'information. \n",
      "ParfaitThe house has a great location, very easy into town and is close to good restaurants and cafes. Vinh was very polite and friendly and had good cafe recommendations.Great access to Light Rail and Buses. Ideal spot for exploring Darling Harbour and further afield.We had an amazing stay in Sydney. We were delayed in arriving and Stuart and Vingh were more than accommodating including offering early check in. Everything was exactly as shown in pics, including their puppy! It's a great location and very comfortable. Loved our stay! Stuart and Vihn are friendly people; easy to talk to, and gave me good advice about where to go. \n",
      "The place doesn't look exactly as the pictures; it could, but I guess is difficult to keep dusted and clut free when both have jobs, and people come over all the time.\n",
      "If your plan is to cook for yourself, it might be a little bit difficult as findings things in the kitchen could take you some time. I suggest to ask them first where the utensils are, instead of opening 10 drawers and still not finding what you are looking for... Not on obvious places.\n",
      "Coffee and breakfast makes everything better, I enjoyed the view from the kitchen with a good cup of coffee :) \n",
      "\n",
      "If other guests are sharing the house during your stay, be aware the bathroom is shared...1 bathroom for up to 4 people...Plan ahead, if you are in a hurry to take a shower or use the toilet, it may take some time until is free to use. \n",
      "The house is well located and easy to access, which was great: location made the stay well worthed.\n",
      "I recomend reading the whole description. Don't hesitate to ask them for further details... Might take them a while to respond, but they are very pleasant to deal with and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for all guys :)It's a lovely neighborhood easy to walk into Sydney city.Lots of special places down the pir. And theirs a lot of good pubs & restaurangs st Harris St...Just take your time and U will found itVihn and Stuart were great hosts! We enjoyed staying at their place very much. Vihn accommodated our early flight and allowed us to check in and drop off our things early. He gave many great recommendations according to what we wanted to do. Being our first airbnb experience, they definitely set the bar high. Would absolutely recommend to anyone wishing to stay close to Sydney. Be aware that this is not accurately represented in the photo or print .Stuart and Vinh are great hosts. And Vinh can speak both English and Chinese. It helps us a lot. :) The whole house is clean and comfortable with nice view. They prepared lots of bread,milk and coffee for us.  The location is convenience to fish market, Darlin Harbor and CBD. Btw, Kenji their dog is a shy boy , very quiet and cute. We definitely will come again if we visit Sydney next time.This place is top notch, exactly as advertised. Locations and views are great and the hospitality of Stuart and Vinh went beyond any reasonable expectation. Both went to great length to accommodate our needs and wishes, making our stay very comfortable. Highly recommended! Just a half hour stroll to city. Vinh is so informative with information about Sydney and will help you find anything. House is always clean and fridge is stocked with breakfast items. They have so many extra things available fort travellers eg books, public travel cards, international adapters, headphones, toiletries etc. You really get a great deal staying here. They are such nice hosts who are very accommodating and make your stay so hassle free. Loved it!房屋分上中下三层,下层为公共区域,我们住二层楼梯处上下楼比较方便｡房屋说在地区非常安静靠近港口,边上有个很大的公园,离the star 步行3-5分钟的路程,交通很方便,如果去CENTER 的话有免费的班车｡\r\n",
      "房东人很好,能说中文和英文,冰箱里的东西都可以自助,唯一不足的是卫生间有点小,刷牙什么不是太方便｡干净程度还有待提高一下｡房屋没有照片中的那么美丽,离想象还是有一定的距离｡总体来说还是比较满意的｡最后还是非常感谢房东的照顾｡Great location, walkable to the city, but secluded enough to be out of traffic. Very friendly and welcoming! My boyfriend and I would definitely recommend staying here if you're visiting Sydney!First, the place is amazing. Beautiful view out the back of the water and a lovely deck to sit and enjoy breakfast at. Vinh and Stuart were so helpful showing us around and telling us about nearby restaurants to check out. Continental breakfast, so you could help yourself to toast or cereal in the morning. Fairly close to the city center, we were able to do it in about 15 min or so. Overall, we had such a great stay! Very easy to arrive at the house with Stuart and Vin direccions\n",
      "The locations was the best, 4 blocks from the pedestrian bridge of Darling Harbour   very amusing places! Bars restaurants, you can go down town easily\n",
      "The hosts amability in every moment, all the things the do for you have the best stay is wonderfull\n",

We hope to be backLovely stay at Vinh and Stuart, we enjoyed the room and it was an excellent location. You can walk to circular quay in 45 minutes from the house.Great place to stay. Highly recommended!I only had a quick stay but everything was great! I arrived after walking for some time in the rain and they offered me a greatly appreciated cup of tea and showed me to my room. The view from the back is gorgeous and the house is located in a great spot, very close to where I had to go for work. \n",
      "\n",
      "Having a business, it was great to chat with the guys, enjoyed some chats with Vinh. Would definitely be back again if the need arose.\n",
      "If you need a massage, I highly recommend Julie Wilson of Body Balance Therapy who is closeby (easy walking distance). She was incredible - the best therapist I have ever seen.Stuart and Vihn are really good host. They help me a lot and provide many traveling suggestions. The location is excellent and worth living. Very close to the Darling Harbor ,the light rail and the Star. The kitchen is open to us, from the kitchen window we can enjoy the view of the park and the sea. Really good experience, thank you for everything.Very close to THE STAR Casino, fish market and darling harbour. Stuart is very kind, outgoing, considerable. The house is tidy, quiet, filled with books and knowledge.Vinh and Stuart were polite and helpful. Their place has a great view of the water and they have all the things you'd need for a comfortable stay including drinks and snacks.  If you're going to be working near or visiting Pyrmont, this is a reliable choice for your stay. The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.A big thank you to Stuart and Vinh for their welcome. The apartment is quiet and the location is perfect to visit Sydney. Easy to access to the public transport. We would come back anytime.很好的一次经历,位置非常好,院子后面就是海岸,早上或者夕阳的时候只是在房子附近散步都是很好的选择｡房东非常贴心,我们预定是在10点退房,但是得知我们是晚上8点的飞机后,他们就允许我们把行李放在他们家里｡你还可以在这吃早餐!他们还给我们提供吐司,各种麦片和咖啡~If you are into the Arts, especially visual art, Stuart and Vinh's home is the place to stay. You will love the ambience. Their home is full of books.  Just by the harbour, you can get anywhere quickly by rail link (tram) and train. Two stops to Pyrmont Bay and the ferry across the harbour. Stuart and Vinh are lovely, generous-hearted hosts. Close enough to everything centrally( 40 minutes walk to harbour) but bus on doorstep takes you halfway. Vinh gives you opal card which you preload for transport. Recommend I'm free walking tour from town hall at 10.30 . Gives you great overview. Had useful tips and nice meal / drinkfrom Tim at Barzini which is 5 minutes away. \n",
      "Instructions on how to get to house are fantastic. Thanks Stuart and Vinh. GreathostsPerfect location for relaxing and walkable distance to the city. Very friendly hosts.This was my first time using this service and the location of Stuart's place was perfect. You are able to walk to everything or easily use the transit system in Sydney. They are wonderful host's and very helpful in helping first visitors navigate the city. I would return and recommend them in the future.  Great location, short walk from Darling harbour and onwards to the CBD/Tourist areas beyond would already make this a great place to stay. However add to that two very gracious hosts and a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere within the house and you have a winner!Nous sommes retournés chez Stuart à l'issue de notre périple.  Ils sont toujours aussi sympathiques et attentionnés. Une très bonne adresse à Sydney.Great location, just a few minutes walk to Pyrmont bridge and Darling Harbour. Extremely accommodating, hospitable and friendly hosts. Although we only booked a room, it felt as though we had the whole house to ourselves. Great value compared to other places in Pyrmont. Great for a quick stay in Sydney with very friendly and helpful hosts! Very nice bedroom with balcony looking to street.  Clean and WiFi. Vinh and Stuart have a nice home in a interesting neighborhood of Sydney.  It is a little bit further than expected for most sights and activities in the main part of Sydney, but the neighborhood was very nice nonetheless.  The Wifi was also slow, if that is important to you.  However, I appreciate them making me feel welcome and enjoyed being able to use the kitchen or sit on the back deck.  Loved having a quiet coffee early morning in the garden...great views. Very central location- we walked everywhere in the city.I very much enjoyed my stay at Stuart and Vinh's place in Pyrmont. A beautiful house in a great location, and good value for money with breakfast provided. Die Lage der Unterkunft ist kaum zu toppen. Das Zimmer ist allerdings sehr hellhörig sodass man Pech haben kann wenn andere Gäste sehr laut sind.Host were accommodating and friendly.  Amenities such as washer and dryer avaliable. Coffee, tea and breakfast supplies were also provided. Location was excellent,close to public transport,groceries and restaurantsGood value place with really nice viewThe location was great! So close to everything. And the hosts were both flexible, and gracious. Just remember, there are steep stairs to the toilet in the middle of the night, but the lighting is designed to help!The combination between homy place, strategic location (it's soo close with Darling Harbor) & supportive host feels like your own family - really made our stay so unforgettable: we feel like we are home & embraced. \n",
      "The stairs is pretty steep as my wife once slipped - but the rest is so great! The location of this airbnb is wonderful! Walking distance to all the main downtown Sydney attractions. The house was clean and had everything we needed. Lovely room in a great location. \n",

In a very pretty area.Very welcoming, non intrusive but there to help.Felt like home.Easy going and welcoming.Stuart and Vinh are such nice hosts.We enjoyed staying this place.

Great easy access. The guys are warm and helpful with a cool easy kitchen and breakfast set up making attending a work function in the city easy. Would recommend!The hosts were exceptionally knowledgeable and hospitable to us. Additionally the location was perfectly close to the city while having a little distance from crowds. Perfect location and very friendly host. Felt welcome.The house is located near the harbor and the view is great. You can easily walk to the park outside to enjoy the scenery. Besides, the house is near the Fish Market where you can enjoy local fresh food. You can take public transport in the John Street Square Station to anywhere. If you want to explore Sydney deeply, Stuart's place is your suitable choice.A very friendly and comfortable home away from home. Very nice to be able to share the kitchen and bathroom. In warmer weather to sit outside and look out at the water would be wonderful. We felt very safe and welcome. Vinh was an amazing host! He made me feel very comfortable to stay there also the location Was pretty good! Easy walk to darling harbor and Star casino, with plenty of nice restaurants nearby too. But, I have to mention the carpet in the house and our room was a bit smelly, my mom barely slept for the first night in addition the quality of the bed & linen wasn't very good. Stuart's place is traditional house in Sydney and near to darling harbour!I was in town for an event so spent most of each day out - but to have such a comfortable house and bed to come home to was a treat. Awesome place in a wonderful location!Location, location, location.  So close to the city and yet it feels like you are in a quiet village.\n",

It is strongly recommended, ha ha ha (房间地理位置非常好,离darling Harbour很近,房间很干净,充满了时尚书香气息,后院临海｡Vinh & Stuart很友好,我们在这里住了2天给了我们很好地旅行建议,下次来悉尼还会考虑住这里｡ 对了 ,里家里几分钟路程的赌场大楼一楼的gelato messina冰淇淋特别好吃,强烈推荐,哈哈哈)This is definitely a good choice!

The room was as described; very clean, comfortable, quiet, and private. There are plenty of nice touches--fresh towels, some toiletries, heater for the winter. You can cook in the kitchen and refrigerator space is provided. A great plus is having a short walk from the local bus or light rail. Vinh and Stuart were extremely professional and communicative. He even invited us to take a look at their art gallery. Would definitely book again--in fact, I think if we would've just moved in if we could have! Highly recommended for a reliable FIVE STAR STAY in the city.Awesome spot and very accommodating hostsStuart and Vinh are lovely, gracious hosts. Very accomodating and helpful.What can i say...super hosts are super hosts...Vinh and Stuart were amazing hosts. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at their place!

Thanks for the great stay :)From the moment we arrived, we really felt at home! We had a very long flight and we were happy to arrive at Stuart and Vinh’s place. We thought we would need public transport to get to the city centre but we really enjoyed walking around everyday and just experiencing the city. We also got some great tips for eating out and what to do during the day. Would definitely stay here on our next trip to Sydney! Excellent hospitality and great location! I highly recommend this place. Stuart and Vinh are lovely hosts and their home has quite the creative touch. Really enjoyed my stay, and I think you will too!

They had so many suggestions for places to go and see/do in Sydney as it was my first time. My room was so cozy and had excellent views! I loved to sit out on the terrace with a cup of coffee in the mornings. Vinh and I even spent a bit of time together one morning getting to know each other. Both he and Stuart are amazing, attentive hosts and the whole experience exceeded my expectations! The location was perfect, easy to get to (they provided detailed instructions which was perfect), and the value was incredible. There were water views!!! Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone staying in Sydney. I will definitely be back!I'm sure you'll be happy here.房子地理位置很便利,有轻轨,也可以步行去达令港坐船观景,房东人特别热心,最后我们走的时候因为下雨,房东直接将他的伞送给了我们,谢谢!下次仍然选你们家!great location, friendly hostsIt was most enjoyableI had a wonderful time staying with Stuart and Vinh. Their house is located in Pyrmont, a VERY centrally located area of Sydney, and I had no trouble getting anywhere. It's also quiet, so I was able to sleep well and get a lot of homework done, as I'm taking online college classes right now. The amenities in the house are great -- an espresso machine, MILK FOAMER (do not understate how great this is), a great shower, heater / AC in room, privacy, beautiful back deck, any cooking utensil you might need ... it's great. I am so lucky to have called this my home base for a week.Vinh and Stuart were great hosts. They were very welcoming, friendly, informative, communicative, and fast response. I really enjoyed my stay at their place and I would highly recommend.Perfect base in Pyrmont to explore the city on foot. Lovely hosts with excellent communication.  Breakfast and good coffee a very welcome touch. Thanks!Friendly hosts, photos of the house's interior are outdated but the room was accurate. Apart from not having towels until we asked for them the stay was generally pleasant. Location is a big plus and the breakfast options plus tea/coffee was a bonus.\n",

      "Overall good value for money- especially if you are visiting Sydney for the first time and you want to stay close to town.While I did not get to interact with Stuart as much, Vinh was very accommodating of our requests and easy to reach. The stay was comfortable and we felt that we had a large amount of private time and Vinh was available to help us when we needed it. Everything was as described in the description 'Five star stay' and my friend and I were grateful we had such lovely hosts!Lovely stay, the city at our doorstep, lots to do and they didn’t our arriving time.Will not disappoint.Staying at Stuart’s place made my trip to Sydney very enjoyable. Before the trip, Stuart would reply to my questions very quickly with great detail. He was there to welcome me when I arrived. Here is what I love about this place: 1). It is in a quiet neighborhood with beautiful view yet without walking distance to most of the places to Darling Harbour. Once you walk to the Harbour, you can get to all the places via rail or ferry easily. 2). Privacy: the bedroom I had was very good size. The house is clean. Although there were other guests there during my visit, the whole place is very quiet and peaceful that I can still get very good rest after long and busy day. 3). Stuart provides variety of breakfast options, a lot of different kind of tea, and fresh fruits which I really appreciated. All in all, a very enjoyable visit for me.This AirBnB is outstanding if you have a conference anywhere in and around Darling Harbour.  The room was clean, well appointed and very comfortable.  The location is amazingly quiet.  I had excellent nights of undisturbed sleep and Stuart’s place is very close to transport (the light rail and also Pyrmont Bay ferry wharf).  The shower was strong and hot; and the guys had an iron and ironing board on hand for me when I needed it.  A great value stay in Sydney!  Enjoy.The landlord is hospitable. Vinh is a Vietnamese Chinese speaker. He speaks Chinese and Cantonese. The house is in a very good location. It's very convenient to walk around Sydney. There are many small restaurants and bars nearby. You can see the sea at the door. Very nice.Stuart and Vinh’s place is truly a 5 stars experiences both from their lovely place and incredible hospitality. Would highly recommend it to anyone who visit SydneySuch a convenient place to stay excellent hosts nothing was too much trouble very happy to greet and helpful in many ways as to where to eat etc extremely quiet and peaceful and bed was really comfortable and clean\n",
